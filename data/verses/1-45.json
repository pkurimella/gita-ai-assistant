  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection",
  "sanskrit": "अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम् ।\nयद्राज्यसुखलोभेन हन्तुं स्वजनमुद्यताः ॥४५॥",
  "transliteration": "aho bata mahat pāpaṁ kartuṁ vyavasitā vayam |\nyad rājya-sukha-lobhena hantuṁ svajanam udyatāḥ ||45||",
  "translation": "Alas! We are resolved to commit a great sin by preparing to kill our own kinsmen out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses deep moral anguish and self-condemnation. He reflects on the gravity of the impending war, viewing it as a terrible sin (mahāpāpa) motivated by greed for royal pleasures and power. Arjuna includes himself in this condemnation by using 'we' (vayam), indicating that he sees both sides—the Kauravas and Pandavas—as equally culpable in this fratricidal conflict. This represents the peak of his moral crisis, where he questions the very foundation and justification of the war.\n\nThis verse is significant because it shows Arjuna's capacity for introspection and moral reasoning. Unlike a mere warrior seeking glory, he demonstrates the ability to question his actions from an ethical standpoint. He recognizes that the desire for kingdom and its pleasures (rājya-sukha-lobha) is driving this destructive conflict. This moment of crisis becomes the catalyst for Krishna's teachings in the subsequent chapters, where the Lord will address these moral dilemmas and reveal deeper truths about dharma, action, and the nature of reality.\n\nThe verse also highlights a key theme of the Gita: the conflict between worldly desires and higher spiritual values. Arjuna's lament sets the stage for Krishna's discourse on performing one's duty without attachment to results, transcending the dualities of gain and loss, and understanding one's true nature beyond the physical body.",
