  "translation": "Arjuna said: O mighty-armed one, O Hrishikesha, O slayer of Keshi, I wish to understand the true nature of sannyasa (renunciation) and tyaga (relinquishment), and the distinction between them.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of the eighteenth and final chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, where Arjuna poses a crucial question about two seemingly similar concepts: sannyasa and tyaga. Throughout the Gita, Krishna has discussed various forms of renunciation and action, and now Arjuna seeks clarity on the precise distinction between these two terms. Sannyasa generally refers to the formal renunciation of all actions and worldly life, while tyaga refers to the relinquishment of the fruits of actions while continuing to perform one's duties. This question sets the stage for Krishna's comprehensive teaching on the nature of true renunciation.\n\nArjuna addresses Krishna with three epithets that are significant: 'Mahabaho' (mighty-armed) acknowledges Krishna's power, 'Hrishikesha' (lord of the senses) recognizes his mastery over the senses, and 'Keshinishudana' (slayer of the demon Keshi) recalls his divine prowess. These appellations suggest that Arjuna is seeking guidance from one who has complete mastery over both the material and spiritual realms. The question is particularly relevant as the Gita approaches its conclusion, synthesizing all previous teachings about karma, jnana, and bhakti yoga into a final understanding of liberation through proper renunciation.",
