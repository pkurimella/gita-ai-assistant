  "transliteration": "kārpaṇya-doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ pṛcchāmi tvāṁ dharma-sammūḍha-cetāḥ | yac chreyaḥ syān niścitaṁ brūhi tan me śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam ||",
  "translation": "My nature is overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about my duty. I ask You: tell me decisively what is best for me. I am Your disciple; please instruct me, for I have taken refuge in You.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial turning point in the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna, who has been lamenting and presenting various arguments against fighting, now recognizes the limitations of his own understanding and formally surrenders to Krishna as a disciple. He acknowledges that his nature has been overcome by weakness (kārpaṇya-doṣa) and that he is confused about his dharma—his righteous duty as a warrior prince.\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in Arjuna's transformation from a friend engaging in dialogue to a disciple seeking spiritual instruction. By saying 'śiṣyas te 'ham' (I am Your disciple) and 'tvāṁ prapannam' (I have taken refuge in You), Arjuna establishes the guru-śiṣya relationship that becomes the foundation for Krishna's teachings throughout the rest of the Gita. This surrender is not merely intellectual curiosity but a genuine spiritual seeking born from existential crisis.\n\nThis verse also highlights the concept of dharma-saṅkaṭa (moral dilemma) that forms the backdrop of the entire Gita. Arjuna's confusion about what constitutes right action in a complex situation represents the universal human predicament of ethical decision-making. His request for 'niścitam' (definitive) guidance shows his readiness to move beyond emotional reasoning to receive transcendental wisdom. This moment of surrender and receptivity is what makes the profound teachings of the Gita possible.",
