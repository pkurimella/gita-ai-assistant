  "transliteration": "bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate |\nvāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ ||",
  "translation": "After many births, the person of true knowledge surrenders unto Me, realizing that Vasudeva (Krishna) is all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.",
  "commentary": "This verse represents the culmination of spiritual evolution described in the preceding verses. Krishna explains that after numerous lifetimes of spiritual practice and accumulated wisdom, a truly enlightened soul comes to the profound realization that the Supreme Reality pervades everything. This is not merely intellectual understanding but a complete experiential realization that transforms one's entire being. The phrase 'Vāsudevaḥ sarvam' (Vasudeva is everything) indicates the highest non-dual understanding where the devotee perceives the Divine presence in all existence.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that such a mahātmā (great soul) is extremely rare (sudurlabha). This rarity is not due to God's selectivity but because achieving this level of realization requires persistent effort across many lifetimes, complete purification of consciousness, and the grace that comes from unwavering devotion. The verse highlights the progressive nature of spiritual development—from worshipping various deities for material gains to ultimately recognizing the one Supreme Reality underlying all manifestations. This represents the transition from saguna (with attributes) to nirguna (attributeless) understanding, though expressed through complete surrender to the personal aspect of the Divine.",
