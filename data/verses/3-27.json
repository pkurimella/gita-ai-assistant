  "translation": "All actions are performed by the three gunas (qualities) of Prakriti (material nature), but one who is deluded by egoism thinks, 'I am the doer.'",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a fundamental teaching of the Bhagavad Gita regarding the nature of action and agency. Krishna explains that all actions in the material world are actually performed by the three gunas—sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance)—which are the constituent qualities of Prakriti or material nature. The body, senses, mind, and intellect are all products of Prakriti and function according to these gunas. However, the ignorant person, deluded by ahamkara (ego or false identification with the body-mind complex), mistakenly believes 'I am the doer' and claims personal authorship of actions.\n\nThis verse is crucial in the context of Karma Yoga as it addresses the root cause of bondage—the false sense of doership. When one identifies with the body and mind, one assumes responsibility for actions and becomes attached to their results, leading to karmic bondage. Krishna is teaching Arjuna that true wisdom lies in understanding that the Self (Atman) is distinct from Prakriti and its operations. The enlightened person recognizes that while actions occur through their body and mind, the true Self remains the witness, untouched by action. This understanding is essential for performing nishkama karma (desireless action) and achieving liberation while remaining engaged in the world.",
