  "translation": "O mighty-armed Krishna, does not one who has fallen from both paths perish like a scattered cloud, without support and bewildered on the path to Brahman?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses a profound concern about the fate of a spiritual aspirant who fails to achieve perfection in yoga during their lifetime. He uses the poignant metaphor of a scattered cloud (chinnābhram) to illustrate his fear—just as a small cloud fragment dissipates without merging with larger clouds or reaching the earth as rain, might not the unsuccessful yogi similarly vanish without achieving either worldly success or spiritual realization? The term 'ubhaya-vibhraṣṭa' (fallen from both) captures Arjuna's worry that such a person loses both material prosperity (by renouncing worldly pursuits) and spiritual attainment (by failing to complete the yogic path).\n\nThis question reveals Arjuna's deep understanding of the commitment required for spiritual practice and his concern for those who sincerely attempt the path but may not complete it in one lifetime. The phrase 'apratiṣṭha' (without foundation or support) emphasizes the vulnerability of one who has abandoned conventional life for spiritual pursuit but has not yet established themselves in the ultimate reality. Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'mahā-bāho' (mighty-armed), appealing to his strength and authority to resolve this crucial doubt. This verse sets up one of the most compassionate and encouraging responses in the Gita, where Krishna will explain the doctrine of spiritual continuity across lifetimes, assuring that no sincere effort on the spiritual path is ever wasted.",
