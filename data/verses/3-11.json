  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the principle of cosmic reciprocity through yajna (sacrifice). The 'gods' (devas) here represent the cosmic forces and natural powers that sustain life. By performing yajna—which includes rituals, duties, and selfless actions—humans support and strengthen these cosmic forces. In turn, these forces provide rain, food, and all necessities for human welfare. This creates a harmonious cycle of mutual sustenance.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all existence and the importance of maintaining cosmic balance through righteous action. The 'supreme good' (param shreyas) mentioned is not merely material prosperity but the ultimate spiritual welfare that comes from living in harmony with the cosmic order. Krishna is teaching that selfish action disrupts this balance, while selfless performance of duty (karma yoga) maintains it. This principle extends beyond ritual sacrifice to include all forms of selfless service and duty performed without attachment to personal gain, which is the central theme of this chapter on Karma Yoga.",
