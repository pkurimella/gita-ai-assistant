  "translation": "If the splendor of a thousand suns were to blaze forth all at once in the sky, that might resemble the radiance of that Supreme Being.",
  "commentary": "This verse is spoken by Sanjaya to King Dhritarashtra as he describes the magnificent vision of the Universal Form (Vishvarupa) that has been revealed to Arjuna. Sanjaya attempts to convey the incomprehensible brilliance and glory of Krishna's cosmic form through a powerful simile. The comparison to a thousand suns blazing simultaneously in the heavens represents the narrator's struggle to find adequate words for something that transcends ordinary human experience and perception.\n\nThe verse serves as a transitional moment in the chapter, bridging the granting of divine vision to Arjuna and the actual description of what he witnesses. It emphasizes the extraordinary, supernatural nature of the vision—something so radiant and overwhelming that even the most brilliant natural phenomenon multiplied a thousandfold can only approximate it. This hyperbolic imagery prepares the reader for the awe-inspiring descriptions that follow, while also highlighting the limitations of human language and conceptual frameworks when attempting to describe the divine.\n\nPhilosophically, this verse underscores a central theme of the Gita: the transcendent nature of the Supreme Reality. The divine form of the Lord surpasses all material comparisons and can only be perceived through divine grace (divya-chakshus or divine vision), not through ordinary sensory perception. The verse reminds us that the ultimate truth is beyond the grasp of the material senses and intellect alone, requiring a transformation of consciousness to be truly comprehended.",
