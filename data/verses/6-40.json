  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: O Partha (Arjuna), neither in this world nor in the next is there destruction for him; never does anyone who does good, dear friend, come to an evil end.",
  "commentary": "In this profoundly reassuring verse, Krishna addresses Arjuna's concern about the fate of a yogi who fails to complete the spiritual path. The Lord categorically declares that one who has embarked on the spiritual journey faces no destruction either in this world (iha) or in the hereafter (amutra). This is a fundamental principle of spiritual evolution—no sincere effort on the path of yoga is ever wasted. The verse provides tremendous encouragement to spiritual aspirants who may fear failure or doubt their ability to reach the ultimate goal.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that anyone who performs kalyāṇa-kṛt (auspicious or virtuous deeds) can never meet with durgatim (an evil or unfortunate destiny). This establishes the law of spiritual progress: every step taken toward self-realization, every moment spent in meditation or righteous action, creates permanent spiritual merit that carries forward. The use of the affectionate term 'tāta' (dear one) shows Krishna's compassion and his desire to remove Arjuna's doubts completely. This verse serves as a cornerstone of hope in the Gita's teaching, assuring seekers that the spiritual path is inherently safe and progressive, with no possibility of ultimate loss for those who sincerely pursue righteousness and self-knowledge.",
