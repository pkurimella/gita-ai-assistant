  "translation": "These two paths—the bright and the dark—are considered to be the eternal paths of the world. By one, a person goes not to return; by the other, one returns again.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna summarizes the two eternal paths described in the previous verses: the path of light (śukla) associated with the six months of the sun's northern course and the path of darkness (kṛṣṇa) associated with the southern course. These are not merely temporal paths but represent fundamental spiritual trajectories available to all beings. The bright path leads to liberation (mokṣa) and no return to the cycle of birth and death, while the dark path leads back to rebirth in the material world.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that these two paths are 'śāśvate' (eternal), meaning they have always existed and will continue to exist as long as the manifest universe endures. This is not a matter of arbitrary divine decree but reflects the natural law of karma and spiritual evolution. The path one takes depends on one's consciousness at death, one's spiritual practices during life, and the degree of self-realization attained. Krishna presents this teaching to help Arjuna understand the cosmic framework within which human spiritual destiny unfolds, encouraging him to pursue the path of light through devotion, knowledge, and righteous action.",
