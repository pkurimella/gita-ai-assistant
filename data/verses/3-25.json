  "translation": "As the ignorant act with attachment to their work, O Bharata, so should the wise act without attachment, desiring the welfare of the world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the principle of enlightened action for the benefit of society. He draws a parallel between how the ignorant perform actions with attachment and how the wise should perform the same actions but without attachment. The key distinction is not in the external action itself, but in the internal attitude and motivation. The ignorant act out of selfish desire and attachment to results, while the wise act from a sense of duty and concern for the welfare of all beings.\n\nThis teaching is central to the concept of Karma Yoga presented in this chapter. Krishna is instructing that the enlightened person should continue to engage in worldly activities, not for personal gain, but to set an example for others and to maintain social order (loka-saṅgraha). If wise people were to abandon action entirely, the masses who look up to them would become confused and society would fall into chaos. Therefore, the wise must act, but with detachment and with the intention of guiding humanity toward higher values. This verse bridges the apparent contradiction between the path of knowledge and the path of action, showing that true wisdom expresses itself through selfless, exemplary action in the world.",
