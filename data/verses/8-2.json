  "transliteration": "adhiyajñaḥ kathaṁ ko'tra dehe'smin madhusūdana |\nprayāṇa-kāle ca kathaṁ jñeyo'si niyatātmabhiḥ ||",
  "translation": "Who is Adhiyajna (the Lord of sacrifice), and how does He dwell in this body, O Madhusudana? And how are You to be known at the time of death by those who are self-controlled?",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Arjuna's series of questions from the previous verse. Having asked about Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, and other metaphysical principles, Arjuna now specifically inquires about Adhiyajna—the presiding deity of all sacrifices. He wants to understand how this divine principle resides within the physical body and what its relationship is to individual existence. The question reveals Arjuna's desire to comprehend the connection between cosmic principles and embodied reality.\n\nThe second part of the verse addresses the crucial question of consciousness at the moment of death (prayāṇa-kāla). Arjuna asks how those who have controlled their minds and senses (niyatātmabhiḥ) can know or remember Krishna at the critical moment of departure from the body. This question sets up one of the central teachings of Chapter 8: that one's state of consciousness at death determines one's future destination. The inquiry demonstrates Arjuna's understanding that theoretical knowledge must translate into practical realization, especially at life's most crucial juncture.\n\nBy addressing Krishna as Madhusudana (slayer of the demon Madhu), Arjuna subtly acknowledges that Krishna alone can destroy the darkness of ignorance regarding these profound mysteries. This verse establishes the framework for Krishna's subsequent teachings on the importance of constant remembrance, the practice of yoga, and the techniques for maintaining divine consciousness at the time of death.",
