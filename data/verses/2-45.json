  "translation": "The Vedas deal with the three gunas (modes of material nature). Be free from these three gunas, O Arjuna. Be free from dualities, ever established in pure sattva, free from thoughts of acquisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.",
  "commentary": "In this pivotal verse, Krishna instructs Arjuna to transcend the limited scope of Vedic ritualism. The Vedas primarily address the three gunas—sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance)—which constitute material nature. While Vedic rituals serve a purpose for those seeking material benefits and gradual spiritual elevation, Krishna urges Arjuna to rise above this level of consciousness. The instruction to become 'nistraiguṇya' means to transcend even sattva, the highest of the three gunas, and reach the pure transcendental state.\n\nKrishna further elaborates that Arjuna should become free from dvandvas (dualities) such as pleasure-pain, heat-cold, honor-dishonor, which constantly disturb the mind of one operating under the influence of the gunas. The phrase 'nitya-sattva-stho' indicates being established in pure existence or pure consciousness, which is beyond the sattva guna of material nature. Additionally, freedom from yoga-kshema (acquisition and preservation) means abandoning anxiety about gaining what one doesn't have and protecting what one possesses.\n\nThis verse represents a crucial turning point in Krishna's teaching, moving from the preliminary discussion of the eternal soul to the practical instruction of transcending material consciousness. By becoming 'ātmavān' (established in the Self), one realizes their true nature as pure consciousness, beyond the temporary fluctuations of material existence. This teaching prepares Arjuna for the higher knowledge of karma yoga and bhakti that follows in subsequent verses.",
