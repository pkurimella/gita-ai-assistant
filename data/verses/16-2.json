  "commentary": "This verse continues the enumeration of divine qualities (daivī sampad) that Krishna began in the previous verse. These twelve virtues represent the ethical and moral foundation of spiritual life. Ahiṁsā (non-violence) heads the list as it is considered the supreme dharma, encompassing not just physical non-harm but also refraining from causing mental and emotional injury to others. Satya (truthfulness) and akrodha (absence of anger) form the basis of harmonious relationships. Tyāga (renunciation) refers to the spirit of letting go of selfish attachments, while śānti (tranquility) indicates inner peace that comes from self-control.\n\nThe remaining qualities address interpersonal conduct and inner refinement. Apaiśunam (absence of slander or fault-finding) and dayā (compassion) cultivate positive relationships with all beings. Aloluptva (non-covetousness) frees one from excessive desires for sensory pleasures. Mārdava (gentleness or softness of nature) makes one approachable and kind. Hrī (modesty or sense of shame regarding wrong actions) acts as an internal moral compass, while acāpalam (steadiness or absence of fickleness) ensures consistency in one's spiritual practice and character. Together, these qualities prepare the aspirant for higher spiritual realization by purifying the mind and establishing ethical excellence.",
