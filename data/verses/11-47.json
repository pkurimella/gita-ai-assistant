  "sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच\nमया प्रसन्नेन तवार्जुनेदं रूपं परं दर्शितमात्मयोगात्।\nतेजोमयं विश्वमनन्तमाद्यं यन्मे त्वदन्येन न दृष्टपूर्वम्॥",
  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nmayā prasannena tavārjunedaṁ rūpaṁ paraṁ darśitam ātma-yogāt |\ntejomayaṁ viśvam anantam ādyaṁ yan me tvad-anyena na dṛṣṭa-pūrvam ||",
  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, being pleased with you, I have shown you, through My own yogic power, this supreme form—effulgent, universal, infinite, and primeval—which has never been seen before by anyone other than you.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna responds to Arjuna's overwhelmed state after witnessing the Vishvarupa (Universal Form). Krishna explains that this extraordinary vision was granted as a special grace due to His pleasure with Arjuna. The Lord emphasizes that this form was revealed through His own divine yogic power (ātma-yoga), indicating that it is not accessible through ordinary means of perception or even through conventional spiritual practices. This revelation was a unique privilege granted to Arjuna.\n\nKrishna describes the Universal Form with four significant attributes: tejomaya (effulgent/radiant), vishva (universal/all-encompassing), ananta (infinite/limitless), and ādya (primeval/original). These qualities emphasize the transcendent and all-pervading nature of the divine reality. The Lord also states that no one before Arjuna had witnessed this form, highlighting the exceptional nature of this theophany. This verse serves as a transition, as Krishna prepares to comfort Arjuna and eventually return to His more accessible four-armed and then two-armed form. The verse underscores the principle that divine grace (prasāda) is essential for the highest spiritual realizations, and that the Supreme Reality reveals itself according to the readiness and devotion of the seeker.",
