  "sanskrit": "न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत्।\nकार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः॥",
  "transliteration": "na hi kaścit kṣaṇam api jātu tiṣṭhaty akarmakṛt |\nkāryate hy avaśaḥ karma sarvaḥ prakṛtijair guṇaiḥ ||",
  "translation": "Verily, none can ever remain even for a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly by the qualities (gunas) born of Prakriti (nature).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a fundamental truth about existence: complete inaction is impossible. Every being is constantly engaged in some form of activity, whether physical, mental, or biological. Even when one appears to be inactive externally, internal processes continue—breathing, thinking, digestion, and cellular activity persist. This verse directly addresses Arjuna's earlier notion that renunciation of action might be superior to performing action.\n\nKrishna explains that all beings are compelled to act by the three gunas (qualities) of prakriti—sattva (purity), rajas (passion), and tamas (inertia). These fundamental forces of material nature govern all activity in the phenomenal world. A person under the influence of these gunas cannot simply cease all action by mere will. This understanding is crucial because it demolishes the false notion that one can achieve spiritual liberation through forced physical inactivity while the mind remains turbulent with desires and attachments.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse lies in its emphasis on the inevitability of action and the need to understand one's relationship with prakriti. Rather than futilely attempting to suppress all action, the wise path is to understand the nature of action, perform one's duties with the right attitude (as Krishna will elaborate), and gradually transcend the binding influence of the gunas through knowledge and devotion. This sets the foundation for karma yoga—the path of selfless action performed without attachment to results.",
