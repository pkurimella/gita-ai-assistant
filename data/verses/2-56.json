  "translation": "One whose mind is not agitated in the midst of sorrows, who has no longing for pleasures, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger—such a person is called a sage of steady wisdom.",
  "commentary": "This verse provides Krishna's response to Arjuna's question about the characteristics of a person established in transcendental consciousness (sthitaprajña). Krishna describes the emotional equilibrium of such a realized soul. The sage of steady wisdom remains unshaken by the dualities of life—neither disturbed by sorrows nor excited by pleasures. This equanimity is not mere suppression of emotions but arises from deep spiritual realization and detachment from the temporary nature of worldly experiences.\n\nThe verse emphasizes three key qualities that must be transcended: rāga (attachment), bhaya (fear), and krodha (anger). These are considered the primary obstacles to spiritual progress in Vedantic philosophy. Attachment binds one to objects of pleasure, fear arises from the possibility of loss, and anger emerges when desires are thwarted. The sthitadhī muni has risen above these reactive patterns through self-knowledge and remains established in the Self regardless of external circumstances.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Sāṅkhya Yoga chapter's message about discriminative wisdom and detachment. It establishes the psychological foundation for karma yoga by showing that true wisdom manifests as emotional stability and freedom from the pairs of opposites (dvandva). Such a person acts in the world without being psychologically affected by results, embodying the ideal that Krishna is presenting to Arjuna as the solution to his crisis on the battlefield.",
