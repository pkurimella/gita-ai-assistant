  "translation": "The unintelligent think of Me, the unmanifest, as having come into manifestation, not knowing My supreme nature, which is imperishable and unsurpassed.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a fundamental misunderstanding about His true nature. Those lacking spiritual intelligence (abuddhayaḥ) perceive Him merely as a human being who has taken physical form, failing to recognize His transcendental, imperishable essence. They see only the manifest (vyakta) form and assume that the Supreme Being was previously unmanifest (avyakta) and has now become manifest, like an ordinary person taking birth.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the distinction between the Supreme Lord's transcendental nature and ordinary material existence. Krishna's appearance in the world is not a transformation from unmanifest to manifest, nor is it a binding material birth. His nature remains eternally supreme (anuttama), imperishable (avyaya), and beyond the material modes. The ignorant fail to comprehend this supreme state (paraṁ bhāvam) and thus cannot properly worship or understand Him. This misunderstanding prevents them from attaining true devotion and liberation, as they relate to Krishna as merely a historical or mythological figure rather than the Supreme Absolute Truth who descends by His own will while maintaining His transcendental position.",
