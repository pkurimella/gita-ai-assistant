  "transliteration": "mayi cānanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhicāriṇī |\nvivikta-deśa-sevitvam aratir jana-saṁsadi ||",
  "translation": "Unswerving devotion to Me through single-minded yoga, resorting to solitary places, and distaste for the company of worldly people.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate the qualities that constitute true knowledge (jñāna). He emphasizes three important aspects of spiritual practice: unwavering devotion (avyabhicāriṇī bhakti) directed exclusively toward the Divine through ananya-yoga (single-pointed yoga), the practice of seeking solitude (vivikta-deśa-sevitvam) for contemplation and meditation, and a natural disinclination (arati) toward crowds and mundane social gatherings.\n\nThe term 'ananya-yoga' is particularly significant, meaning devotion that does not deviate to any other object or goal. This exclusive devotion is not mere emotional attachment but a disciplined, yogic connection with the Supreme. The preference for solitary places does not imply misanthropy or escapism, but rather reflects the understanding that spiritual practice requires periods of withdrawal from external distractions. Similarly, the distaste for crowds refers specifically to gatherings focused on worldly matters that disturb mental equilibrium and dissipate spiritual energy. These qualities create the conducive environment and mental disposition necessary for Self-realization, which is the ultimate subject of this chapter on distinguishing between the field (body-mind) and its Knower (the Self).",
