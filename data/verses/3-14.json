  "translation": "From food, all beings come into existence; from rain, food is produced; from sacrifice, rain comes forth; and sacrifice is born of prescribed action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the cosmic cycle of interdependence that sustains all life. He traces the chain of causation backwards: living beings depend on food (anna), food depends on rain (parjanya), rain depends on sacrifice (yajña), and sacrifice depends on prescribed actions (karma). This verse reveals the fundamental interconnectedness of all existence and demonstrates that individual actions are part of a larger cosmic order.\n\nThe term 'yajña' here refers not merely to ritualistic sacrifice, but to all selfless actions performed in accordance with dharma and in service to the cosmic order. When humans perform their duties without selfish attachment, they contribute to maintaining the natural cycles that sustain all life. This verse emphasizes that human beings are not isolated entities but integral parts of an ecological and spiritual system. By neglecting one's duties or acting selfishly, one disrupts this cosmic harmony.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Karma Yoga philosophy of Chapter 3, where Krishna advocates for engaged action rather than renunciation. The verse establishes that action (karma) is not merely a personal choice but a cosmic necessity that maintains the wheel of creation. It provides the philosophical foundation for why Arjuna must fulfill his duty as a warrior, as all beings are bound by this cycle of mutual dependence and obligation.",
