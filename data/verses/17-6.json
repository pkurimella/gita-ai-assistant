  "sanskrit": "कर्षयन्तः शरीरस्थं भूतग्राममचेतसः ।\nमां चैवान्तःशरीरस्थं तान्विद्ध्यासुरनिश्चयान् ॥६॥",
  "transliteration": "karṣayantaḥ śarīra-sthaṁ bhūta-grāmam acetasaḥ |\nmāṁ caivāntaḥ śarīra-sthaṁ tān viddhyāsura-niścayān ||6||",
  "translation": "Those who torture the aggregate of elements in the body, being senseless, and also Me who dwells within the body—know them to be of demoniac resolve.",
  "commentary": "This verse concludes Krishna's description of those who practice severe, unauthorized austerities not prescribed by the scriptures. Such practitioners are described as 'acetasaḥ' (senseless or unintelligent) because they lack proper discrimination and understanding. They torture not only the physical body and its constituent elements (the bhūta-grāma), but also harm the Divine presence that resides within every being.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that such extreme practices, motivated by ego, attachment, desire, or hypocrisy (as mentioned in the previous verse), are actually demoniac (āsura) in nature, despite appearing to be spiritual disciplines. This is a crucial teaching that distinguishes genuine spiritual practice from mere physical torture. True austerity should purify and elevate consciousness, not destroy the body which is the temple of the Divine. By harming the body excessively, these practitioners also show disrespect to the Supreme Soul (Paramātmā) dwelling within.\n\nThis verse serves as a warning against extremism in spiritual practice and reinforces the Gita's consistent message of balance and moderation. The path of yoga is a middle way that honors both the body as an instrument of spiritual practice and the Divine presence within. Those who adopt extreme measures out of pride or ignorance are moving away from, rather than toward, spiritual realization.",
