  "sanskrit": "भवान्भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च कृपश्च समितिञ्जयः |\nअश्वत्थामा विकर्णश्च सौमदत्तिस्तथैव च ||८||",
  "transliteration": "bhavān bhīṣmaś ca karṇaś ca kṛpaś ca samitiñjayaḥ |\naśvatthāmā vikarṇaś ca saumadattis tathaiva ca ||8||",
  "translation": "There are yourself (Bhishma), Karna, Kripa—ever victorious in battle, Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and also Bhurishrava, the son of Somadatta.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Duryodhana continues his enumeration of the great warriors assembled on the Kaurava side. He addresses Bhishma with the respectful term 'bhavān' (yourself), acknowledging the grandsire's supreme position. He then lists formidable warriors including Karna, known for his loyalty and martial prowess; Kripacharya, one of the royal preceptors; Ashvatthama, son of Dronacharya and possessor of devastating weapons; Vikarna, one of Duryodhana's own brothers who was known for his sense of justice; and Bhurishrava (Saumadatti), son of Somadatta, a renowned warrior of the Kuru dynasty.\n\nDuryodhana's strategic purpose in this enumeration becomes clear—he is attempting to bolster confidence by highlighting the strength of his army while simultaneously ensuring that these great warriors remain committed to the battle. The epithet 'samitiñjayaḥ' (ever victorious in battle) applied to Kripa emphasizes the invincibility that Duryodhana wishes to project. This verse reveals Duryodhana's character as a leader who understands the importance of morale and recognition, yet it also foreshadows the tragic irony that despite such mighty warriors, the Kauravas are destined to fall due to their adherence to adharma (unrighteousness). The verse sets the stage for the great moral and philosophical teachings that will follow when Arjuna faces his crisis of conscience.",
