  "translation": "One who is equal in censure and praise, silent, content with whatever comes, without attachment to dwelling place, steady-minded, and full of devotion—such a person is dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues describing the qualities of His dear devotee, emphasizing equanimity and contentment. The devotee who remains balanced whether receiving criticism or praise demonstrates true spiritual maturity, recognizing that both are temporary and superficial. Being 'maunī' (silent or contemplative) indicates one who has controlled speech and maintains inner stillness, not engaging in unnecessary talk or gossip. The quality of being content with whatever circumstances arise (santuṣṭo yena kenacit) reflects complete surrender to divine will and freedom from material desires.\n\nThe term 'aniketaḥ' (without attachment to dwelling) is particularly significant, indicating either a literal renunciant or one who, while living in a home, maintains inner detachment from material possessions and place. This quality demonstrates that the devotee's true home is in the Divine, not in any physical location. 'Sthira-matiḥ' (steady-minded) points to unwavering determination and focus on the spiritual path, unshaken by life's ups and downs. These qualities together paint a picture of a devotee who has transcended worldly dualities and remains anchored in devotional consciousness regardless of external circumstances, making such a person supremely dear to the Lord.",
