  "translation": "Some yogis perform sacrifice to the gods alone, while others offer the sacrifice itself as an oblation into the fire of Brahman through sacrifice.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his exposition on the various forms of sacrifice (yajña) that spiritual seekers perform. He describes two distinct approaches: some yogis worship through traditional rituals directed toward celestial deities (daivam), following the path of devotion and ritualistic worship. These practitioners maintain the conventional understanding of sacrifice as an offering to divine powers.\n\nThe second category represents a more advanced spiritual practice where yogis offer sacrifice itself into the fire of Brahman (brahmāgni). This represents the path of knowledge (jñāna-yoga) where the very act of sacrifice becomes the offering, transcending the duality of worshipper and worshipped. Here, the sacrifice is not directed toward external deities but is merged into the supreme reality of Brahman. This metaphorical fire of Brahman represents the ultimate consciousness that consumes all dualistic notions.\n\nThis verse is significant in the context of Chapter 4 as it illustrates the diversity of spiritual paths while pointing toward the superiority of knowledge-based sacrifice. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that all forms of action, when performed with the right understanding, can lead to liberation. The verse bridges devotional practices with the higher wisdom of non-dual realization, showing how different temperaments and levels of spiritual evolution require different approaches to the same ultimate goal.",
