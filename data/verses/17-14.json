  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna defines śārīra tapa (bodily austerity) as part of the threefold classification of tapas (austerities). He outlines five specific practices that constitute physical discipline. The worship of deva (gods), dvija (twice-born, referring to brahmins and those who have undergone spiritual initiation), guru (spiritual teachers), and prājña (the wise) represents reverence for higher knowledge and spiritual authority. Śauca (purity) refers to both external cleanliness and internal purification. Ārjava (straightforwardness) means simplicity and honesty in one's physical conduct and dealings.\n\nBrahmacharya, often translated as celibacy, more broadly means control over sensual desires and the conservation of vital energy for spiritual purposes. Ahiṁsā (non-violence) is the practice of not causing harm to any living being through physical action. These five practices together constitute the austerity of the body, which when performed with the right attitude (as will be elaborated in subsequent verses), purifies the physical instrument and makes it conducive to spiritual growth. This verse is part of Krishna's larger teaching on the three types of faith and how they manifest in various practices, helping Arjuna understand that true spiritual discipline encompasses body, speech, and mind.",
