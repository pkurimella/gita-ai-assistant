  "sanskrit": "मां च योऽव्यभिचारेण भक्तियोगेन सेवते ।\nस गुणान्समतीत्यैतान्ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते ॥२६॥",
  "transliteration": "māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate |\nsa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate ||26||",
  "translation": "And one who serves Me with unwavering devotion through the yoga of devotion, transcending these three gunas, becomes qualified for attaining Brahman (union with the Absolute).",
  "commentary": "This verse presents the supreme method for transcending the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) that Krishna has been describing throughout this chapter. The key is avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yoga—unwavering, exclusive devotion to the Divine. When one serves Krishna with single-pointed devotion that does not waver or deviate, one automatically rises above the influence of the three modes of material nature. This is not a gradual process of first cultivating sattva, then transcending it, but rather a direct path that bypasses the entire system of gunas.\n\nThe phrase 'brahma-bhūyāya kalpate' indicates that such a devotee becomes fit for or qualified to attain Brahman-realization—the state of absolute consciousness. This is significant because it shows that bhakti-yoga is not merely an emotional or devotional practice, but a complete spiritual path that leads to the highest realization. The devotee who practices unwavering devotion naturally develops all the qualities of one who has transcended the gunas, as described in the previous verses. This verse serves as the practical answer to Arjuna's question at the beginning of the chapter about how to transcend the gunas, establishing bhakti as the most direct and effective means.",
