  "translation": "Therefore, with the sword of knowledge of the Self, cut asunder this doubt born of ignorance that resides in your heart. Established in yoga, arise and fight, O Bharata!",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 4 serves as Krishna's powerful call to action for Arjuna. Krishna urges Arjuna to use the sword of self-knowledge (jñānāsi) to destroy the doubt (saṁśaya) that has arisen from ignorance (ajñāna) and has taken residence in his heart. This metaphor of the sword of knowledge is particularly apt in the warrior context, transforming spiritual wisdom into a weapon against delusion. The doubt Krishna refers to encompasses all of Arjuna's confusion about dharma, action, and his role in the impending battle.\n\nThe verse synthesizes the key teachings of the chapter: the nature of action and inaction, the importance of knowledge, and the path of karma yoga. Krishna emphasizes that true knowledge dispels all doubts and enables one to act decisively while remaining established in yoga (yogam ātiṣṭha). This is not mere intellectual understanding but transformative wisdom that cuts through the root of confusion. The command 'uttiṣṭha' (arise) is both literal—stand up and fight—and metaphorical—rise above your delusion and fulfill your dharma.\n\nThis verse marks a transition point in the Gita, as Krishna has now completed his exposition on the yoga of knowledge and action. By addressing Arjuna as 'Bhārata' (descendant of Bharata), Krishna reminds him of his noble lineage and duty. The verse encapsulates the practical application of all the philosophical teachings: knowledge must lead to appropriate action, and spiritual wisdom should empower one to fulfill one's dharma without attachment or doubt. It establishes that the path of yoga is not passive contemplation but active engagement with life's duties, performed with wisdom and equanimity.",
