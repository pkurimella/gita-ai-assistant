  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Madhusudana, O slayer of enemies, how can I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his deep moral dilemma about fighting against his revered elders. He addresses Krishna as Madhusudana (slayer of the demon Madhu) and Arisudana (destroyer of enemies), perhaps hoping that Krishna, who has destroyed demons, might understand the impossibility of fighting against those who deserve reverence rather than violence. Bhishma was Arjuna's grand-uncle and the patriarch of the Kuru dynasty, while Drona was his beloved teacher who taught him the art of archery. Both were worthy of worship (pūjārhau) according to dharmic tradition.\n\nThis verse reveals the conflict between two dharmas that Arjuna faces: his duty as a warrior (kshatriya-dharma) to fight for justice, and his duty toward elders and teachers (guru-dharma) to honor and serve them. The use of the word 'iṣubhiḥ' (with arrows) emphasizes the violent nature of the act he is being asked to perform against those he has always revered. This emotional appeal sets the stage for Krishna's teaching on the nature of duty, the eternal self, and the proper understanding of dharma that forms the core of the Bhagavad Gita's philosophy.",
