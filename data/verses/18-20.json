  "translation": "That knowledge by which one sees the one imperishable reality in all beings, undivided in the divided—know that knowledge to be sattvic (born of goodness).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins his analysis of knowledge (jñāna) according to the three gunas. Sattvic knowledge is characterized by the perception of unity in diversity—the ability to see the one eternal, imperishable essence pervading all beings despite their apparent multiplicity and differences. This is the highest form of knowledge as it perceives the underlying oneness of existence, recognizing that the same divine consciousness dwells in all creatures, though they appear separate in their physical forms.\n\nThis verse is central to Vedantic philosophy and represents the culminating wisdom of the Gita. The sattvic knower transcends superficial differences of name, form, species, and characteristics to perceive the fundamental unity of all existence. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential—it transforms one's perception of reality and naturally leads to compassion, equanimity, and spiritual liberation. The term 'avibhaktam vibhakteṣu' (undivided in the divided) beautifully captures the paradox of the One appearing as many, which is resolved only through sattvic knowledge that sees beyond appearances to the eternal truth.",
