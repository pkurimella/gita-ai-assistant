  "translation": "Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor fire illumines that Supreme Abode of Mine, reaching which they do not return (to this world of birth and death).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the transcendental nature of His supreme abode, which exists beyond the material realm. Unlike the material world that requires external sources of illumination such as the sun, moon, or fire, the spiritual realm is self-luminous and self-effulgent. This divine abode is characterized by its own inherent radiance that surpasses all material light sources. The verse emphasizes that this realm is not subject to the limitations of material nature and does not depend on any external agency for its existence or illumination.\n\nThe second half of the verse reveals the most significant quality of this supreme abode: those who reach it attain liberation (mokṣa) and never return to the cycle of birth and death (saṁsāra). This is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice described throughout the Gita. The phrase 'paramaṁ mama' (My Supreme Abode) indicates that this is Krishna's own eternal realm, the highest spiritual destination. This verse connects to the chapter's theme of understanding the Supreme Person (Puruṣottama) and distinguishes between the perishable material world (represented by the inverted tree in earlier verses) and the imperishable spiritual reality. Attaining this abode represents the culmination of spiritual evolution and the end of all material suffering.",
