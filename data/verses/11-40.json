  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his profound hymn of praise and surrender to Krishna's universal form. Having witnessed the cosmic manifestation, Arjuna offers salutations from all directions—front, back, and all sides—recognizing that the Divine cannot be confined to any single direction or dimension. This omnidirectional prostration symbolizes complete surrender and acknowledgment that God pervades all space and time.\n\nArjuna addresses Krishna as possessing infinite power (ananta-vīrya) and immeasurable valor (amita-vikrama), recognizing that the Divine's strength and prowess are beyond all measurement and limitation. The verse culminates in the profound realization that because Krishna pervades everything (sarvaṁ samāpnoṣi), He is indeed everything (asi sarvaḥ). This is a direct expression of the non-dualistic understanding that the Supreme Reality is not merely present in all things, but is the very essence and totality of existence itself.\n\nThis verse represents a key moment in Arjuna's spiritual evolution, where he moves from seeing Krishna as merely his friend and charioteer to recognizing Him as the all-pervading Supreme Reality. The philosophical significance lies in the understanding that true devotion involves recognizing the Divine not as a separate entity to be worshipped from a distance, but as the very ground of all being, deserving reverence from every direction because there is no place where the Divine is not present.",
