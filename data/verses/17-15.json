  "sanskrit": "अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत् |\nस्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते ||",
  "transliteration": "anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ satyaṁ priya-hitaṁ ca yat |\nsvādhyāyābhyasanaṁ caiva vāṅmayaṁ tapa ucyate ||",
  "translation": "Speech that causes no agitation, that is truthful, pleasant and beneficial, and the regular practice of Vedic study—this is said to be the austerity of speech.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes vāṅmayaṁ tapa, the austerity or discipline of speech, as part of the threefold tapas (austerity of body, speech, and mind). Krishna outlines four essential qualities of sattvic speech: it should be anudvega-karam (non-agitating, not causing anxiety or distress in others), satya (truthful), priya (pleasant or agreeable), and hita (beneficial or wholesome). This combination is significant because truth alone without kindness can be harsh, and pleasant words without truth can be deceptive. The ideal speech harmonizes all these qualities.\n\nThe verse also includes svādhyāya-abhyasana (regular study and recitation of sacred texts) as part of verbal austerity. This practice purifies speech at its source by filling the mind with sacred knowledge and divine thoughts. In the context of Chapter 17's discussion of faith and the three gunas, this verse presents the sattvic approach to speech—one that uplifts both the speaker and the listener. It stands in contrast to rajasic speech (which might be truthful but harsh) and tamasic speech (which causes pain, is false, or worthless). The discipline of speech is considered a powerful spiritual practice because words have the power to create or destroy, to heal or harm, making their proper use essential for spiritual progress.",
