  "sanskrit": "यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः ।\nन स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् ॥२३॥",
  "transliteration": "yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ |\nna sa siddhim avāpnoti na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim ||23||",
  "translation": "One who discards the injunctions of the scriptures and acts according to one's own whims and desires attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme goal.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as a crucial warning about the consequences of abandoning scriptural guidance. Krishna emphasizes that those who reject the wisdom of the śāstras (scriptures) and instead follow their own capricious desires and impulses fail to achieve any of the three essential goals of human life: siddhi (perfection or accomplishment), sukha (happiness or contentment), and parā gati (the supreme destination or liberation). The verse establishes that scriptural injunctions are not arbitrary restrictions but essential guidelines for human welfare and spiritual progress.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 16, which delineates the divine and demoniac qualities, this verse concludes the description of demoniac tendencies by highlighting their ultimate futility. Acting on the basis of kāma-kāra (desire-driven impulses) rather than śāstra-vidhi (scriptural ordinances) characterizes the demoniac nature. The triple negation (na...na...na) emphasizes the complete failure that results from such an approach. This verse sets up the following verses which will establish the authority of scriptures as the proper standard for determining right action, thereby providing the transition to the chapter's conclusion and practical guidance for spiritual seekers.",
