  "sanskrit": "यद्यप्येते न पश्यन्ति लोभोपहतचेतसः।\nकुलक्षयकृतं दोषं मित्रद्रोहे च पातकम्॥",
  "transliteration": "yady apy ete na paśyanti lobhopahata-cetasaḥ |\nkula-kṣaya-kṛtaṁ doṣaṁ mitra-drohe ca pātakam ||",
  "translation": "Though these men, with their minds overpowered by greed, see no wrong in the destruction of the family and no sin in treachery to friends,",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna acknowledges that his opponents, the Kauravas, are blinded by greed and ambition. Their consciousness has been clouded by avarice (lobha), preventing them from recognizing the grave sins they are about to commit. They cannot perceive the fault in destroying their own family lineage (kula-kṣaya) nor the sin in betraying friends and relatives. This verse demonstrates Arjuna's moral clarity in contrast to his enemies' ethical blindness.\n\nArjuna uses this observation as part of his argument for why he should not fight. He is setting up a contrast between those who are morally blind due to greed and those like himself who can clearly see the consequences of war. The verse reflects the dharmic principle that greed is one of the primary obstacles to right understanding and right action. Even though the Kauravas cannot see their wrongdoing, Arjuna believes that he, with clear vision, should not participate in actions that will lead to the destruction of family and social order.\n\nThis verse is significant in the overall narrative because it shows Arjuna's ethical reasoning and his concern for dharma. However, Krishna will later reveal that Arjuna's understanding, though appearing righteous, is incomplete. The verse sets up the fundamental tension of the Gita: the conflict between conventional morality and higher spiritual duty, between emotional attachment and detached action in accordance with one's svadharma.",
