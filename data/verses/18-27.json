  "transliteration": "rāgī karma-phala-prepsur lubdho hiṁsātmako'śuciḥ |\nharṣa-śokānvitaḥ kartā rājasaḥ parikīrtitaḥ ||18.27||",
  "translation": "The agent who is passionate, desirous of the fruits of action, greedy, violent by nature, impure, and moved by joy and sorrow—such an agent is declared to be rajasic (of the mode of passion).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his analysis of the three types of agents (kartā) based on the three gunas, now describing the rajasic agent. This person is characterized by rāga (attachment and passion), constantly seeking the fruits of their actions rather than performing duty for its own sake. The rajasic agent is driven by desire (kāma-phala-prepsuh), greed (lubdha), and possesses a violent or harmful disposition (hiṁsātmaka). Such a person lacks purity of intention and conduct (aśuci), being motivated by selfish interests rather than dharma.\n\nThe rajasic agent is further characterized by emotional instability—being subject to harṣa (elation) and śoka (grief) depending on whether their desires are fulfilled or frustrated. This emotional volatility reveals the fundamental insecurity and dependence on external outcomes that defines the passionate nature. Unlike the sattvic agent who remains equipoised, the rajasic person experiences extreme highs and lows, their inner state entirely dependent on the success or failure of their endeavors. This verse serves as a warning against allowing passion and desire to dominate one's actions, as it leads to suffering and bondage rather than liberation.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 18's comprehensive analysis of the three gunas and their manifestation in various aspects of life—knowledge, action, agent, intellect, and resolve. Understanding the rajasic nature of agency helps the spiritual aspirant recognize and transcend these qualities in themselves, moving toward the sattvic and ultimately the transcendent state beyond all gunas.",
