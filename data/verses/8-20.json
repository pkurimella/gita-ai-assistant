  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound metaphysical truth about the ultimate reality that transcends even the unmanifest state of cosmic dissolution. He distinguishes between two levels of the unmanifest (avyakta): the lower unmanifest which is the seed state of material creation that emerges and dissolves cyclically, and the higher unmanifest which is the eternal, imperishable Supreme Reality. This supreme unmanifest is described as sanātana (eternal) and exists beyond the cycles of cosmic creation and dissolution.\n\nThis verse is crucial in establishing the hierarchy of existence in Vedantic philosophy. While the previous verses discussed the manifest and unmanifest states within the cycle of creation, this verse points to the transcendent reality that remains unchanged and unaffected by these cosmic cycles. When all beings and even the unmanifest prakriti dissolve at the end of the cosmic cycle, this supreme unmanifest Being remains eternally existent. This is the ultimate goal of the spiritual seeker—to realize and attain this imperishable state.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that there are gradations of reality, and the highest reality is beyond all change, beyond all manifestation and unmanifestation. This supreme state is the true nature of Brahman or the Supreme Person, which Krishna will further elaborate in the next verse. This teaching provides hope and direction to spiritual aspirants, showing that there exists an eternal refuge beyond all temporal existence.",
