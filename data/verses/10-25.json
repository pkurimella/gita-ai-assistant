  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate His divine manifestations across various categories of existence. He identifies Himself with Bhrigu, one of the seven great sages (Saptarishi) and the progenitor of the Bhrigu lineage, representing the pinnacle of spiritual wisdom and Vedic knowledge. Among all words and sounds, Krishna declares Himself to be the sacred syllable Om (pranava), which is considered the primordial sound from which all creation emanates and the most concentrated representation of Brahman in sound form.\n\nKrishna then identifies with japa-yajna, the sacrifice of silent repetition or meditation, which is considered the highest form of yajna because it requires no external materials and can be performed by anyone at any time. This represents the internalization of spiritual practice and the supremacy of mental worship over ritualistic ceremonies. Finally, among all immovable objects (sthavara), Krishna identifies with the Himalayas, the mightiest and most majestic mountain range, symbolizing stability, grandeur, and the sublime heights of spiritual aspiration. These manifestations collectively point to the supreme, the essential, the most accessible, and the most magnificent in their respective categories, guiding the devotee to recognize the Divine in excellence wherever it appears.",
