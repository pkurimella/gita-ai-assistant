  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\ntaṁ tathā kṛpayāviṣṭam aśru-pūrṇākulekṣaṇam\nviṣīdantam idaṁ vākyam uvāca madhusūdanaḥ",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: To him who was thus overcome with pity, whose eyes were filled with tears and troubled, who was despondent, Madhusudana (Krishna) spoke these words.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as the crucial transition from the first chapter's emotional crisis to the second chapter's profound philosophical teachings. Sanjaya, narrating the events to the blind king Dhritarashtra, describes Arjuna's pitiable condition—overwhelmed by compassion (kṛpā), with tear-filled eyes, and deeply despondent. This sets the stage for Krishna's response, which will constitute the heart of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings.\n\nThe verse emphasizes Arjuna's complete emotional breakdown, showing him not as a warrior ready for battle but as a confused human being paralyzed by moral dilemma. His compassion, though seemingly noble, has led to delusion and inaction. The use of 'Madhusudana' (slayer of the demon Madhu) as Krishna's epithet is significant—it suggests that Krishna is about to destroy the 'demon' of Arjuna's ignorance and delusion just as he once slew Madhu.\n\nThis moment marks the beginning of the Sāṅkhya Yoga chapter, where Krishna will systematically address Arjuna's confusion through discriminative knowledge (jñāna) and the understanding of the eternal nature of the Self. The contrast between Arjuna's emotional state and the timeless wisdom that follows highlights the Gita's central purpose: to guide humanity from confusion to clarity, from sorrow to equanimity.",
