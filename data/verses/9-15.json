  "translation": "Others, offering the sacrifice of knowledge, worship Me as the One, as the separate, and as the manifold, facing in all directions.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes another category of devotees who worship Him through jñāna-yajña (the sacrifice of knowledge). These seekers approach the Divine through different philosophical perspectives. Some worship Him in His unity (ekatvena), recognizing the non-dual nature of reality where the individual soul and Supreme Soul are one. Others worship Him as separate (pṛthaktvena), maintaining the distinction between the worshipper and the worshipped in dualistic devotion. Still others see Him manifested in many forms (bahudhā), recognizing the Divine presence in the multiplicity of creation.\n\nThe phrase 'viśvato-mukham' (facing in all directions) indicates that God pervades all aspects of existence and can be approached from various philosophical standpoints. This verse demonstrates Krishna's acceptance of different spiritual paths and philosophical approaches to the Divine. Whether one follows the path of non-dualism (Advaita), qualified non-dualism (Vishishtadvaita), or dualism (Dvaita), all are valid means of worship when performed with sincere devotion and understanding. This inclusive vision is characteristic of the Gita's universal teaching, which honors the diversity of spiritual temperaments and intellectual approaches while pointing to the same ultimate Reality.",
