  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides an alternative path for those who find it difficult to maintain constant, unwavering concentration on the Divine. Recognizing that not everyone can immediately achieve the state of continuous meditation described in the previous verse, Krishna compassionately offers the path of abhyasa-yoga—the yoga of practice. This involves repeated, disciplined effort to train the mind gradually toward one-pointed focus on the Supreme.\n\nAbhyasa-yoga refers to systematic spiritual practice that includes meditation, contemplation, and various yogic disciplines performed regularly over time. Unlike the spontaneous, natural devotion of advanced practitioners, this path acknowledges human limitations and works with them progressively. Through consistent practice, the aspirant gradually strengthens their concentration and devotion, eventually reaching the same goal. This verse demonstrates Krishna's pedagogical wisdom in offering graduated paths suited to different levels of spiritual capacity, ensuring that no sincere seeker is left without a practical method for spiritual advancement.",
