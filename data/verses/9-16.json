  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals His all-pervading nature by identifying Himself with every aspect of Vedic ritualistic worship. He declares that He is not merely the recipient of worship but is present in every component of the ritual itself—from the ritual ceremony (kratu) to the sacrifice (yajña), from the offerings to ancestors (svadhā) to the medicinal herbs (auṣadham). This comprehensive enumeration demonstrates that the Divine is both the means and the end of all spiritual practices.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality where the worshipper, the act of worship, and the object of worship are all manifestations of the same Supreme Reality. Krishna is the mantra being chanted, the ghee being offered, the fire that receives the offering, and the very act of offering itself. This teaching elevates ritualistic worship from mere mechanical performance to a recognition of the Divine presence in every element. It suggests that true worship is the recognition of this all-pervading consciousness in every aspect of the ritual, transforming external ceremony into internal realization of unity with the Divine.",
