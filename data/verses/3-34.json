  "translation": "Attraction and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses. One should not come under the control of these two, for they are obstacles on one's path.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna warns Arjuna about the fundamental obstacles to spiritual progress: rāga (attraction) and dveṣa (aversion). These twin forces naturally arise in the interaction between the senses and their objects. When the eyes see a beautiful form, attraction arises; when they see something unpleasant, aversion develops. This is the natural functioning of the senses, but Krishna emphasizes that one must not fall under their control. These pairs of opposites are inherent in sensory experience itself, not in the Self.\n\nThe significance of this teaching within Chapter 3 is crucial. After explaining the necessity of performing one's duty and engaging in action, Krishna now addresses the primary internal enemies that prevent proper action—attachment and hatred. These emotional responses cloud judgment, create bondage, and lead one away from dharma. They are called 'paripanthinau' (obstacles or enemies on the path) because they obstruct both worldly success and spiritual liberation. When one acts under the influence of likes and dislikes rather than from a sense of duty and wisdom, actions become binding rather than liberating.\n\nKrishna's instruction is not to suppress the senses or deny their natural functioning, but rather to remain free from being controlled by the attractions and repulsions that arise. This requires developing viveka (discrimination) and vairāgya (dispassion). One should perform actions based on dharma and wisdom rather than being driven by emotional reactions. This verse serves as a warning that even while performing one's prescribed duties, if one is controlled by rāga-dveṣa, the actions will not lead to liberation but to further bondage.",
