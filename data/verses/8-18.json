  "translation": "From the unmanifest, all manifestations emerge at the coming of day; at the coming of night, they dissolve into that very same unmanifest.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the cosmic cycle of manifestation and dissolution that occurs with each day and night of Brahma. At the dawn of Brahma's day (kalpa), which lasts 4.32 billion human years, all beings and worlds emerge from the unmanifest (avyakta) state into manifest existence. When Brahma's night arrives, lasting an equal duration, all manifested beings and worlds dissolve back into the same unmanifest condition. This process repeats cyclically throughout cosmic time.\n\nKrishna presents this teaching to help Arjuna understand the temporary and cyclical nature of material existence. The countless beings who emerge and dissolve in this cosmic rhythm are bound by this process unless they attain liberation. This verse sets up the contrast with the supreme imperishable state described in subsequent verses, which transcends this cycle of manifestation and dissolution. The unmanifest mentioned here is not the ultimate reality but rather prakriti in its undifferentiated state, the material cause from which the universe periodically emerges and into which it dissolves.",
