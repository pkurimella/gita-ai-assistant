  "sanskrit": "सर्वेन्द्रियगुणाभासं सर्वेन्द्रियविवर्जितम् ।\nअसक्तं सर्वभृच्चैव निर्गुणं गुणभोक्तृ च ॥१५॥",
  "transliteration": "sarvendriya-guṇābhāsaṁ sarvendriya-vivarjitam |\nasakataṁ sarva-bhṛc caiva nirguṇaṁ guṇa-bhoktṛ ca ||15||",
  "translation": "It appears to possess the functions of all the senses, yet is devoid of all senses; unattached, yet sustaining all; free from the gunas (qualities of nature), yet the experiencer of the gunas.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the paradoxical nature of the Supreme Self (Kṣetrajña) through a series of apparent contradictions. The Self appears to see, hear, and perceive through the senses, yet it is itself without sensory organs. It illuminates all sensory experiences but remains distinct from them. Though it sustains and supports all beings and phenomena, it remains completely unattached and uninvolved in their activities, much like space that contains everything yet remains untouched by what it contains.\n\nThe verse further explains that while the Self is beyond the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) that constitute prakṛti (material nature), it appears to experience them through its association with the body-mind complex. This is the fundamental teaching of Vedānta: the Self is simultaneously transcendent and immanent. It is the witness consciousness that makes all experience possible, yet remains forever unchanged by those experiences. This understanding is crucial for discriminating between the eternal Knower (Kṣetrajña) and the temporary field (Kṣetra), which is the central theme of this chapter. The realization of this truth leads to liberation, as one recognizes one's true nature as the unchanging witness beyond all modifications of matter and mind.",
