  "sanskrit": "काङ्क्षन्तः कर्मणां सिद्धिं यजन्त इह देवताः।\nक्षिप्रं हि मानुषे लोके सिद्धिर्भवति कर्मजा॥",
  "transliteration": "kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṃ siddhiṃ yajanta iha devatāḥ |\nkṣipraṃ hi mānuṣe loke siddhir bhavati karmajā ||",
  "translation": "Those who desire success in their actions worship the gods in this world, for success born of action comes quickly in the human realm.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains why many people worship various deities rather than seeking the Supreme Reality. Those who are attached to the fruits of their actions and desire quick, tangible results perform rituals and worship different gods (devatās) to fulfill specific material desires. Krishna observes that such worship does indeed yield results swiftly in the human world, which is why it remains popular among those seeking worldly success, prosperity, health, or other material gains.\n\nThis verse must be understood in the context of the chapter's broader teaching about different paths and their relative merits. Krishna is not condemning deity worship but rather explaining its limitations. While worship of deities can bring quick results in the material sphere, these results are temporary and keep one bound to the cycle of karma. The verse implicitly contrasts this approach with the worship of the Supreme (mentioned in the previous verse), which leads to liberation rather than temporary gains. Krishna is highlighting that the human birth is particularly suited for karmic activities and their fruits manifest rapidly here, unlike in other realms.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding the hierarchy of spiritual practices. While deity worship for material ends is valid and effective within its scope, it represents a lower stage of spiritual evolution compared to seeking knowledge of the Absolute. This verse encourages discrimination (viveka) in choosing one's spiritual path based on whether one seeks temporary worldly success or eternal liberation.",
