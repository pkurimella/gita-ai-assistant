  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his exposition on the various forms of sacrifice (yajña) by describing four additional categories practiced by spiritual aspirants. He mentions those who perform dravya-yajña (material sacrifices through charity and wealth), tapo-yajña (sacrifices through austerities and penance), yoga-yajña (sacrifices through yogic practices and meditation), and svādhyāya-jñāna-yajña (sacrifices through scriptural study and pursuit of knowledge). The term 'yatayaḥ saṁśita-vratāḥ' emphasizes that these practitioners are disciplined ascetics with sharpened and purified vows.\n\nThis verse is significant in the broader context of Chapter 4, where Krishna is explaining how all actions can be transformed into yajña when performed with the right understanding and attitude. By presenting these diverse forms of sacrifice, Krishna demonstrates that spiritual practice is not limited to ritual worship alone but encompasses various paths suited to different temperaments and capacities. Whether one's inclination is toward charity, austerity, meditation, or study, all can be valid spiritual practices when performed with dedication and proper understanding. This inclusive vision validates multiple approaches to spiritual growth while maintaining that the essence of all these practices is the spirit of sacrifice—the offering of one's resources, efforts, and ego for a higher purpose.",
