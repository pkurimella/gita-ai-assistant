  "sanskrit": "इदमद्य मया लब्धमिमं प्राप्स्ये मनोरथम् ।\nइदमस्तीदमपि मे भविष्यति पुनर्धनम् ॥१३॥",
  "transliteration": "idam adya mayā labdham imaṁ prāpsye manoratham |\nidam astīdam api me bhaviṣyati punar dhanam ||13||",
  "translation": "\"This has been gained by me today, and this desire I shall fulfill. This wealth is mine, and that also shall be mine in the future.\"",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of the demoniac mentality by revealing the thought patterns of those possessed by asuric qualities. The verse depicts the internal monologue of a person driven by greed, acquisition, and material ambition. Such individuals are constantly preoccupied with what they have obtained, what they desire to obtain, and what they plan to acquire in the future. Their consciousness is entirely absorbed in the accumulation of wealth and the fulfillment of endless desires, with no thought given to dharma, spiritual growth, or the welfare of others.\n\nThe repetitive use of 'idam' (this) emphasizes the obsessive nature of materialistic thinking, where the mind constantly fixates on objects of possession and desire. This mental state represents a fundamental delusion where one's identity becomes completely enmeshed with material acquisitions. The phrase 'manoratham' (desire of the mind) indicates that such persons are driven by fantasies and ambitions that have no end. This verse illustrates how the demoniac nature creates a perpetual cycle of craving and temporary satisfaction, leading to spiritual stagnation. In the broader context of Chapter 16, this verse serves as a warning against allowing one's consciousness to be dominated by material considerations at the expense of spiritual values and ethical conduct.",
