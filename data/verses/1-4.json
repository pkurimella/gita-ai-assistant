  "transliteration": "atra śūrā maheṣvāsā bhīmārjuna-samā yudhi |\nyuyudhāno virāṭaś ca drupadaś ca mahā-rathaḥ ||4||",
  "translation": "Here are heroes, mighty archers, equal in battle to Bhima and Arjuna—Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, the great chariot-warrior.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Duryodhana continues his enumeration of the powerful warriors assembled on the Pandava side. He specifically mentions three great warriors: Yuyudhana (also known as Satyaki), Virata, and Drupada. The verse reveals Duryodhana's anxiety as he compares these warriors to Bhima and Arjuna, acknowledging their formidable prowess in battle. This comparison is significant because Bhima and Arjuna were universally recognized as among the greatest warriors of their time.\n\nThe term 'mahā-rathaḥ' (great chariot-warrior) is a technical designation for a warrior of the highest caliber, one who could single-handedly fight ten thousand ordinary warriors. By listing these names, Duryodhana is essentially taking stock of the opposition's strength, perhaps to motivate his own teacher Drona, or possibly revealing his own underlying insecurity despite having superior numbers. This verse continues to set the stage for the great conflict and demonstrates the magnitude of the forces arrayed on both sides.\n\nThe detailed cataloging of warriors in these opening verses serves a literary purpose of building tension and establishing the gravity of the impending battle. It also provides context for understanding why Arjuna's subsequent crisis of conscience is so significant—this is not a minor skirmish but a war involving the greatest heroes of the age, many of whom are related by blood or bound by ties of affection and duty.",
