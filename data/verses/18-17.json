  "translation": "One who is free from the egoistic notion of being the doer, and whose intelligence is not tainted—even though he slays these people, he does not truly slay, nor is he bound by the action.",
  "commentary": "This profound verse addresses the nature of true actionlessness in action, a central theme of the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna explains that a person who has transcended ego (ahaṅkāra) and whose intellect remains untainted by attachment does not incur karmic bondage even while performing actions that appear violent or extreme. The key is the internal state of consciousness rather than the external appearance of the action. When one acts without the false identification of 'I am the doer' and without attachment to results, the action does not bind the soul.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Arjuna's dilemma about fighting in the war. Krishna is not advocating violence but explaining the metaphysical principle that actions performed in the right consciousness—free from ego and attachment—do not create karmic consequences. The enlightened person understands that the Self (Ātman) neither acts nor is affected by actions; it is only the body and mind that engage in activity. This understanding liberates one from the bondage of karma while still allowing one to fulfill one's dharmic duties in the world.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two critical qualities: absence of ego (nāhaṅkṛta bhāva) and untainted intelligence (buddhi na lipyate). These represent the perfection of karma yoga, where action is performed with complete detachment and self-knowledge. Such a person recognizes that all actions are performed by the guṇas of prakṛti (material nature) while the Self remains the eternal witness, untouched and unaffected.",
