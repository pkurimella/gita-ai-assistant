  "translation": "O Partha, have you heard this with a concentrated mind? O Dhananjaya, has your delusion born of ignorance been completely destroyed?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna concludes His divine discourse by inquiring whether Arjuna has truly absorbed the teachings with full attention and concentration. The question 'kaccid etac chrutam' (have you heard this) goes beyond mere auditory reception—it asks whether Arjuna has internalized the profound wisdom with complete mental focus (ekāgreṇa cetasā). This emphasizes that spiritual knowledge requires not just passive listening but active, one-pointed concentration of the mind.\n\nKrishna then asks the crucial question whether Arjuna's fundamental delusion (ajñāna-sammohah) has been dispelled. This delusion, rooted in ignorance about the true nature of the Self, duty, and reality, was what caused Arjuna's initial despondency on the battlefield. The entire Gita was delivered to remove this confusion and restore Arjuna to clarity about his dharma. By addressing Arjuna as 'Dhananjaya' (winner of wealth), Krishna reminds him of his inherent capability and valor, suggesting that with the removal of ignorance, his true nature as a warrior will naturally manifest.\n\nThis verse serves as a pivotal transition point where the teacher checks the student's comprehension before allowing him to make his own decision. It demonstrates the pedagogical approach of the Gita—not to impose dogma, but to illuminate truth and allow the disciple to arrive at understanding through their own awakened intelligence. The verse underscores that the ultimate purpose of all the teachings was the destruction of ignorance and the restoration of discriminative wisdom.",
