  "sanskrit": "नान्तोऽस्ति मम दिव्यानां विभूतीनां परन्तप।\nएष तूद्देशतः प्रोक्तो विभूतेर्विस्तरो मया॥",
  "transliteration": "nānto 'sti mama divyānāṁ vibhūtīnāṁ parantapa |\neṣa tūddeśataḥ prokto vibhūter vistaro mayā ||",
  "translation": "There is no end to My divine manifestations, O Arjuna, scorcher of foes. What I have declared to you is merely illustrative of the extent of My infinite glories.",
  "commentary": "In this concluding verse of the enumeration of divine manifestations, Krishna emphasizes the infinite and inexhaustible nature of His vibhūtis. After describing numerous manifestations across various categories—from the cosmic to the earthly, from the abstract to the concrete—Krishna clarifies that these examples represent only a fraction of His divine expressions. The term 'ananta' (endless) underscores that no finite description can capture the totality of the Divine's manifestations in creation.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'parantapa' (scorcher of foes), reminding him of his warrior nature even while discussing profound metaphysical truths. The word 'uddeśataḥ' (by way of example or illustration) is crucial—it indicates that the preceding verses were not meant to be exhaustive but representative. This teaching method serves a pedagogical purpose: by providing concrete examples, Krishna helps Arjuna develop the vision to recognize the Divine in all excellent and powerful manifestations throughout creation.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for the next verse, which will provide a unifying principle for understanding all manifestations. The philosophical significance lies in pointing to the transcendent nature of the Divine—while God pervades all creation through His vibhūtis, He simultaneously remains beyond all enumeration and categorization. This paradox of immanence and transcendence is central to the Gita's theology, preparing the devotee to see the Divine everywhere while recognizing that the Supreme Reality infinitely exceeds all manifestations.",
