  "translation": "The faith of each person is in accordance with their nature, O Bharata. A person is made up of their faith; as is one's faith, so indeed is that person.",
  "commentary": "This pivotal verse establishes the fundamental relationship between faith (śraddhā) and one's inherent nature (sattva). Krishna explains to Arjuna that faith is not arbitrary but arises from the dominant quality (guna) present in an individual's nature. The faith one holds reflects the composition of one's inner being, shaped by the three gunas—sattva, rajas, and tamas. This verse emphasizes that faith is not merely an intellectual belief but a deep-seated orientation that pervades one's entire being.\n\nThe profound statement 'śraddhāmayaḥ puruṣaḥ' (a person is made of faith) reveals that faith is constitutive of human identity. Whatever a person has faith in, that shapes their character, actions, and ultimately their destiny. This is not a passive relationship—one's faith actively molds one's personality and determines the direction of spiritual evolution. The verse serves as a foundation for the subsequent discussion in Chapter 17, where Krishna will elaborate on how the three types of faith manifest in worship, food preferences, austerities, and charity.\n\nThis teaching has practical implications for spiritual development. It suggests that by understanding the nature of one's faith, one can recognize the predominant guna operating within oneself. More importantly, it implies that by consciously cultivating sattvic faith through proper discrimination and guidance, one can transform one's nature and progress spiritually. The verse underscores the importance of examining what we place our faith in, as this determines who we become.",
