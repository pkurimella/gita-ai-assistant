  "translation": "Supreme bliss comes to the yogi whose mind is perfectly tranquil, whose passions are calmed, who is free from sin, and who has become one with Brahman.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of supreme happiness that comes to the accomplished yogi who has attained complete mental tranquility. Krishna emphasizes that this highest bliss (sukham uttamam) is not a temporary pleasure but the ultimate spiritual fulfillment that arises when the mind becomes perfectly peaceful (praśānta-manasam). The yogi in this state has transcended the mode of passion (rajas), which is the source of restless desires and agitation, and has become established in pure sattva leading to transcendence.\n\nThe verse highlights four essential qualities of such a yogi: a tranquil mind, calmed passions, freedom from impurities or sins (akalmaṣam), and the state of brahma-bhūta—having become one with Brahman. This brahma-bhūta state represents the realization of one's true nature as the Self, beyond bodily identification. It is a state of perfect equanimity and spiritual purity where the yogi experiences the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self. This verse connects directly to the previous verses describing the characteristics of the self-controlled yogi and leads to the subsequent verses that elaborate on the vision of unity that such a yogi experiences. The supreme happiness mentioned here is not dependent on external circumstances but is the natural state of the soul established in its true nature.",
