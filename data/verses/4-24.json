  "transliteration": "brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havirbrahma-agnau brahmaṇā hutam |\nbrahmaiva tena gantavyaṁ brahma-karma-samādhinā ||4.24||",
  "translation": "Brahman is the offering, Brahman is the oblation poured out by Brahman into the fire of Brahman. Brahman alone is to be reached by one who is absorbed in Brahman-action (who sees Brahman in all action).",
  "commentary": "This verse is one of the most celebrated in the Bhagavad Gita, presenting the vision of complete non-duality in action. Krishna describes the sacrificial act where every element—the ladle (arpaṇa), the oblation (havis), the fire (agni), the offerer, and the act itself—are all seen as Brahman, the ultimate Reality. This represents the highest form of karma yoga where the performer transcends the sense of doership and sees the Divine in every aspect of action. The verse transforms ordinary ritual into a profound meditation on unity.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 4, which deals with jñāna-yoga (the path of knowledge) and karma-yoga (the path of action), this verse bridges both paths. It shows how action performed with the knowledge of non-duality becomes a means of liberation rather than bondage. When one performs actions with this consciousness—seeing Brahman as both the means and the end—the action itself becomes a form of worship and meditation. This is what Krishna means by 'brahma-karma-samādhi'—complete absorption in the consciousness of Brahman while performing action.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in its presentation of advaita (non-dual) vision applied to daily life. It is not merely theoretical knowledge but a practical approach to spiritualizing all activities. One who develops this vision naturally attains Brahman because their consciousness is already established in that Reality. This verse has been extensively commented upon by Adi Shankaracharya and other philosophers as encapsulating the essence of seeing unity in diversity and transforming all action into yoga.",
