  "sanskrit": "सखेति मत्वा प्रसभं यदुक्तं हे कृष्ण हे यादव हे सखेति ।\nअजानता महिमानं तवेदं मया प्रमादात्प्रणयेन वापि ॥",
  "transliteration": "sakheti matvā prasabhaṁ yad uktaṁ he kṛṣṇa he yādava he sakheti |\najānatā mahimānaṁ tavedaṁ mayā pramādāt praṇayena vāpi ||",
  "translation": "Whatever I have said rashly, thinking of You merely as a friend, addressing You as 'O Krishna, O Yadava, O Friend,' not knowing this greatness of Yours—through negligence or even through affection—",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna begins his heartfelt apology to Krishna after witnessing the awe-inspiring Universal Form (Vishvarupa). Having seen the cosmic reality of Krishna's divine nature, Arjuna realizes how casually and familiarly he had been treating the Supreme Lord all along. He acknowledges that he had addressed Krishna informally as a friend and companion, calling Him by familiar names like 'Krishna' and 'Yadava,' without understanding His true divine majesty and infinite nature.\n\nArjuna's confession reveals two possible reasons for his previous casual behavior: pramāda (negligence or carelessness) and praṇaya (affection or love). The negligence refers to his ignorance of Krishna's supreme status, while the affection indicates the intimate friendship they shared. This verse demonstrates the profound transformation in Arjuna's understanding—from seeing Krishna as merely a charioteer and friend to recognizing Him as the Supreme Reality. It also illustrates an important spiritual principle: that divine incarnations often conceal their true nature to maintain intimate relationships with devotees, and when that nature is revealed, it inspires both awe and a sense of one's previous presumption.\n\nThis verse is part of a larger passage where Arjuna seeks forgiveness for any disrespect shown to Krishna, whether in jest, during recreation, while resting, sitting, or eating, either alone or in the presence of others. It reflects the devotee's humility upon realizing the true nature of the Divine and sets the stage for understanding the relationship between the personal and impersonal aspects of God.",
