  "translation": "One who is established in equanimous wisdom casts off in this life both good and evil deeds. Therefore, devote yourself to yoga; yoga is skill in action.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most celebrated definitions in the Bhagavad Gita: 'Yoga is skill in action' (yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam). Krishna explains that a person endowed with buddhi-yoga—the yoga of discriminative wisdom—transcends the binding effects of both virtuous (sukṛta) and sinful (duṣkṛta) actions. This transcendence occurs not through inaction, but through performing actions with equanimity and without attachment to results. The person established in such wisdom is freed from the karmic bondage that ordinarily binds one to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe term 'kauśalam' (skill or dexterity) indicates that yoga is not mere mechanical action, but action performed with awareness, balance, and detachment. This skill lies in maintaining mental equilibrium in success and failure, pleasure and pain, while performing one's duties. Krishna urges Arjuna to engage in this yoga, emphasizing that it is the practical path to liberation. This verse serves as a bridge between the philosophical teachings of Sāṅkhya and the practical application of Karma Yoga, showing that true wisdom manifests as skillful, detached action rather than renunciation of action itself.",
