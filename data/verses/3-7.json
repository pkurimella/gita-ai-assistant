  "transliteration": "yas tv indriyāṇi manasā niyamyārabhate'rjuna |\nkarmendriyaiḥ karma-yogam asaktaḥ sa viśiṣyate ||7||",
  "translation": "But one who controls the senses with the mind, O Arjuna, and engages the organs of action in Karma Yoga, remaining unattached—such a person excels.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the superior path of action performed with detachment. He contrasts this with the hypocritical renunciant mentioned in the previous verse who merely suppresses external actions while harboring desires internally. The person who truly excels is one who consciously controls the senses through mental discipline (manasā niyamya) while actively engaging in work through the organs of action. This is the essence of Karma Yoga—performing one's duties without attachment to results.\n\nThe key distinction Krishna makes here is between mechanical suppression and conscious control. The superior practitioner does not flee from action or forcibly restrain the senses, but rather engages them purposefully under the guidance of a disciplined mind. The word 'asaktaḥ' (unattached) is crucial—it indicates that the person performs actions without selfish desire or expectation of personal gain. This verse establishes that genuine spiritual practice involves active engagement with the world, not withdrawal from it, as long as one maintains inner detachment and mental mastery over the senses.",
