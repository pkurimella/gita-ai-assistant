  "transliteration": "adharmaṁ dharmam iti yā manyate tamasāvṛtā |\nsarvārthān viparītāṁś ca buddhiḥ sā pārtha tāmasī ||32||",
  "translation": "That intellect which, enveloped in darkness, imagines unrighteousness to be righteousness, and perceives all things in a perverted manner—that intellect, O Partha, is tamasic.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the tamasic (ignorant) type of intellect, completing his threefold classification of buddhi (intellect) based on the three gunas. This is the lowest and most deluded form of understanding, characterized by complete inversion of values and perception. The tamasic intellect, being shrouded in darkness (tamasāvṛtā), fundamentally mistakes adharma (unrighteousness) for dharma (righteousness), leading to a completely distorted worldview.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18's comprehensive analysis of the three gunas and their manifestations in various aspects of human life. The tamasic intellect represents the most dangerous form of delusion because it not only fails to perceive truth but actively inverts it, making wrong appear right and right appear wrong. Such an intellect sees all things in a perverted manner (viparītāṁś), leading to actions that bind one further to ignorance and suffering. This stands in stark contrast to the sattvic intellect described earlier, which clearly discriminates between dharma and adharma, bondage and liberation.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this teaching lies in its warning about the complete moral and spiritual disorientation that results from tamasic influence. When the intellect itself is corrupted by tamas, it becomes impossible to make correct judgments about right and wrong, leading to a life of increasing darkness and bondage. Krishna's description serves as a call for self-examination and the cultivation of sattva through proper discrimination, knowledge, and spiritual practice.",
