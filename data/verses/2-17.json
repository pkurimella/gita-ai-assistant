  "translation": "Know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. No one can bring about the destruction of this imperishable reality.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the nature of the eternal Self (Ātman) that pervades all existence. He contrasts the imperishable reality with the perishable body discussed in previous verses. The Self is described as that which pervades everything—it is the substratum of all existence, the consciousness that illuminates all experiences. This all-pervading nature indicates its infinite and unchanging character.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the absolute indestructibility of this reality. Unlike the physical body which is subject to birth, growth, decay, and death, the Self is avyaya (imperishable, unchanging). No force in the universe—no weapon, fire, water, or wind—can destroy it. This teaching directly addresses Arjuna's grief over the impending death of his relatives by pointing to the deeper truth that the real essence of beings cannot be killed.\n\nThis verse is foundational to Vedantic philosophy and the Gita's teaching on the distinction between the eternal and the temporal. By understanding this truth, one transcends sorrow born of identification with the body. The verse prepares the ground for the subsequent teaching that the wise do not grieve for either the living or the dead, as they recognize the immortal nature of the Self beyond all bodily changes.",
