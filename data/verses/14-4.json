  "transliteration": "sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ |\ntāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā ||",
  "translation": "O son of Kunti, whatever forms are born in all the various wombs, the great Brahman (Prakriti) is their womb, and I am the seed-giving Father.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna explains the cosmic process of creation and His relationship to all beings. He declares that Prakriti (primordial nature), also called Mahat Brahma or the great Brahman, serves as the universal womb from which all forms emerge across all species and realms of existence. Krishna identifies Himself as the seed-giving Father who impregnates this cosmic womb with the consciousness that becomes individual souls.\n\nThis verse establishes the fundamental relationship between Purusha (consciousness/spirit) and Prakriti (matter/nature) in the creative process. All beings, regardless of their form or species, are products of this divine union between Krishna's consciousness and material nature. The verse emphasizes the universal parenthood of the Divine - Prakriti as the mother providing the material body and circumstances, and Krishna as the father providing the spiritual essence or consciousness. This understanding dissolves all artificial distinctions between beings, as all share the same divine parentage.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in recognizing that while bodies and forms differ due to the modifications of Prakriti and the three gunas (which is the subject of this chapter), the essential spiritual nature comes from the same divine source. This verse sets the foundation for understanding how the gunas operate within this framework of divine creation, affecting all beings born from this cosmic union.",
