  "transliteration": "iṣṭān bhogān hi vo devā dāsyante yajña-bhāvitāḥ |\ntair dattān apradāyaibhyo yo bhuṅkte stena eva saḥ ||",
  "translation": "The deities, nourished by sacrifice, will bestow upon you the desired enjoyments. But one who enjoys what is given by them without offering in return is verily a thief.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes the principle of cosmic reciprocity and the ethics of yajna (sacrifice). Krishna explains that the devas (cosmic forces or deities) are sustained and pleased by sacrificial offerings and rituals, and in return they provide humanity with rain, food, prosperity, and other necessities of life. This creates a sacred cycle of mutual sustenance between humans and the cosmic order. The verse emphasizes that this relationship is not one-sided—it requires active participation through sacrifice and offering.\n\nThe second half of the verse delivers a strong moral injunction. Those who consume the gifts of nature and the bounties provided by the devas without making appropriate offerings or performing their duties are compared to thieves. This is because they take from the cosmic system without contributing back to it, thereby breaking the sacred cycle of reciprocity. This concept extends beyond ritualistic sacrifice to include performing one's dharma, sharing with others, and acknowledging that all resources ultimately come from a divine source. The verse thus connects individual action with cosmic harmony, showing how selfish consumption without contribution disrupts both social and cosmic order.",
