  "sanskrit": "यामिमां पुष्पितां वाचं प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः।\nवेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः।।",
  "transliteration": "yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ pravadanty avipaścitaḥ |\nveda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha nānyad astīti vādinaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those who are of limited understanding, O Partha, are attached to the flowery words of the Vedas and declare that there is nothing beyond the ritualistic portions, saying 'this is all there is.'",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins a critique of those who misunderstand the true purpose of the Vedas. He describes people of limited wisdom (avipaścitaḥ) who are captivated by the ornate, flowery language (puṣpitāṁ vācam) of the Vedic texts, particularly the sections dealing with rituals and ceremonies aimed at material gains. These individuals become so engrossed in the ritualistic aspects and the promises of heavenly pleasures that they fail to perceive the deeper spiritual truths contained within the scriptures.\n\nKrishna characterizes such people as 'veda-vāda-ratāḥ'—those who delight in mere Vedic rhetoric without grasping the essential message. They proclaim that the ritualistic portions of the Vedas, which promise sensory enjoyments and heavenly rewards, constitute the ultimate truth, declaring 'nānyad asti' (nothing else exists). This narrow interpretation keeps them bound to the cycle of desire and action, preventing them from understanding the transcendental knowledge that leads to liberation.\n\nThis verse is significant in the context of Chapter 2 because Krishna is establishing the superiority of discriminative wisdom (Sāṅkhya) and selfless action (Karma Yoga) over mere ritualistic performance motivated by desire for results. He is preparing Arjuna to understand that true spiritual knowledge transcends the limited perspective of those who seek only material and heavenly pleasures through Vedic rituals, pointing instead toward the eternal nature of the Self and the path of liberation.",
