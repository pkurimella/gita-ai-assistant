  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nsu-durdarśam idaṁ rūpaṁ dṛṣṭavān asi yan mama |\ndevā apy asya rūpasya nityaṁ darśana-kāṅkṣiṇaḥ ||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: This form of Mine that you have seen is extremely difficult to behold. Even the gods are ever eager to see this form.",
  "commentary": "After resuming His gentle four-armed form and then His two-armed human form, Krishna explains to Arjuna the rarity and supreme value of what he has just witnessed. The Lord emphasizes that the vision Arjuna received is 'sudurdarśa'—exceedingly difficult to see. This is not merely the cosmic universal form (viśvarūpa) that terrified Arjuna, but specifically refers to Krishna's beautiful human form which He has now resumed. Even the celestial gods (devas) constantly yearn for a glimpse of this form, yet it remains elusive to them.\n\nThis verse serves as a transition in the chapter, moving from the overwhelming cosmic vision back to the intimate, personal relationship between Krishna and Arjuna. Krishna is reassuring Arjuna of the special privilege he has been granted—not just to witness the universal form, but more importantly, to have constant access to the Lord's most charming and accessible form. The verse underscores a key teaching of the Gita: that the personal form of God, approached through devotion, is even more significant than the impersonal, cosmic manifestation. This prepares the ground for the subsequent verses where Krishna will explain that such a vision comes only through exclusive devotion (ananya-bhakti), not through Vedic study, austerities, or rituals alone.",
