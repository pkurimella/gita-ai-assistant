  "translation": "With these seemingly conflicting words, You are confusing my understanding. Therefore, please tell me decisively that one path by which I may attain the highest good.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his confusion regarding Krishna's teachings. In the previous chapter, Krishna emphasized knowledge (jñāna) and the nature of the Self, while at the beginning of this chapter, He praised action (karma). To Arjuna, these instructions appear contradictory—if knowledge is superior, why should he engage in the terrible action of war? This confusion reflects a common misunderstanding about the relationship between knowledge and action in spiritual life.\n\nArjuna's perplexity is genuine and represents the confusion many seekers face when confronted with different spiritual paths. He requests Krishna to speak decisively (niścitya) and recommend one clear path (tad ekam) that will lead to his ultimate welfare (śreyas). This verse sets the stage for Krishna's detailed exposition on Karma Yoga in this chapter, where He will clarify that knowledge and action are not contradictory but complementary paths, and that for most people, the path of selfless action is the appropriate means to purify the mind and ultimately attain Self-knowledge.\n\nThe verse highlights an important pedagogical moment in the Gita where the student openly admits confusion and seeks clarity. Arjuna's honest questioning demonstrates the proper attitude of a spiritual seeker—not blind acceptance, but sincere inquiry when understanding is unclear. Krishna will respond by explaining that action performed without attachment, as an offering to the Divine, is itself a form of yoga that prepares one for the highest knowledge.",
