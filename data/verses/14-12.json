  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the specific signs and symptoms that manifest when the mode of passion (rajas) becomes predominant in a person. These characteristics are distinctly different from those of sattva described in the previous verse. Greed (lobha) refers to an insatiable desire for accumulation and acquisition. Activity (pravṛtti) indicates constant engagement in worldly pursuits. The undertaking of actions (ārambha karmaṇām) refers to the initiation of numerous projects driven by desire for results. Restlessness (aśama) denotes the inability to remain peaceful or content, and craving (spṛhā) represents intense longing for sensory pleasures and material gains.\n\nThese symptoms reveal the dynamic, agitated nature of rajas. Unlike sattva which brings clarity and peace, rajas creates a state of perpetual motion, dissatisfaction, and desire-driven action. The person dominated by rajas is constantly seeking more—more wealth, more pleasure, more recognition—yet never finds lasting satisfaction. This mode binds the soul through attachment to action and its fruits, keeping one trapped in the cycle of karma. Understanding these signs helps spiritual aspirants recognize when rajas is influencing their consciousness, enabling them to consciously cultivate sattva through proper discrimination and spiritual practice.",
