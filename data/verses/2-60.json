  "translation": "O son of Kunti, the turbulent senses forcibly carry away the mind even of a wise person who is striving for perfection.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna warns Arjuna about the formidable power of the senses. Even when a person possesses discrimination (vipaścitaḥ) and is actively engaged in spiritual practice (yatataḥ), the senses can still violently disturb the mind. The word 'pramāthīni' indicates the turbulent and agitating nature of the senses, while 'prasabham' emphasizes their forceful and violent manner of operation. This verse serves as a cautionary statement about the challenges of self-control.\n\nThis teaching comes in the context of Krishna's discourse on sthitaprajña (the person of steady wisdom) and the importance of sense control. Krishna is building his argument systematically, showing that mere intellectual understanding is insufficient; one must be constantly vigilant against the pull of the senses. The verse underscores that spiritual practice requires continuous effort and cannot be taken lightly, as even advanced practitioners can be swept away by sensory impulses.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in recognizing the inherent difficulty of the spiritual path. Krishna is not presenting an idealistic view but a realistic assessment of human psychology. This prepares Arjuna (and all seekers) for the challenges ahead and emphasizes the need for sustained practice, discrimination, and ultimately, complete surrender to the Divine will as the means to overcome the tyranny of the senses.",
