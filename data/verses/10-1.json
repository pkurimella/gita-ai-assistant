  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of the tenth chapter, known as Vibhūti Yoga, where Krishna reveals His divine manifestations and glories. Krishna addresses Arjuna affectionately as 'mahā-bāho' (mighty-armed), acknowledging both his martial prowess and his receptivity as a devoted disciple. The Lord emphasizes that He will now speak 'paramaṁ vacaḥ' (supreme word), indicating that what follows is of the highest importance and represents the culmination of the teachings thus far.\n\nThe verse reveals the intimate relationship between teacher and student, as Krishna states He speaks out of love for Arjuna ('prīyamāṇāya') and with the desire for his ultimate welfare ('hita-kāmyayā'). This sets the tone for the entire chapter, which will elaborate on Krishna's infinite manifestations throughout creation. The teaching is not merely philosophical instruction but a loving revelation meant to deepen Arjuna's devotion and understanding. By asking Arjuna to listen 'again' (bhūyaḥ eva), Krishna indicates that this teaching builds upon and complements what has already been taught, particularly the knowledge of His transcendental nature discussed in previous chapters.",
