  "sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विताः।\nतेषां निष्ठा तु का कृष्ण सत्त्वमाहो रजस्तमः॥",
  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nye śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ |\nteṣāṁ niṣṭhā tu kā kṛṣṇa sattvam āho rajas tamaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Krishna, what is the condition of those who worship with faith but disregard the scriptural injunctions? Is their faith born of sattva, rajas, or tamas?",
  "commentary": "This verse marks Arjuna's inquiry that initiates Chapter 17, which explores the nature of faith (śraddhā) and its threefold classification according to the guṇas. Arjuna poses a practical question about those who worship sincerely with faith but do not follow the prescribed scriptural methods. This question arises naturally from the previous chapter's discussion about following śāstric injunctions versus acting according to desire. Arjuna wants to understand the spiritual standing of such practitioners—are they progressing or regressing on the spiritual path?\n\nThe question reveals a deep philosophical concern: if faith itself is present, does the absence of scriptural knowledge or adherence necessarily condemn one's spiritual practice? Arjuna specifically asks Krishna to classify such faith according to the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), recognizing that not all faith is of the same quality. This sets the stage for Krishna's detailed exposition on how the three modes of material nature influence every aspect of human life—faith, worship, food, sacrifice, austerity, and charity. The verse demonstrates Arjuna's growing sophistication in understanding that spiritual life is nuanced and that faith itself can be conditioned by one's inner nature.",
