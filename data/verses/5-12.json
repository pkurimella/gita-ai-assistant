  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Renunciation of Action",
  "sanskrit": "युक्तः कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्नोति नैष्ठिकीम्।\nअयुक्तः कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "yuktaḥ karmaphalaṃ tyaktvā śāntim āpnoti naiṣṭhikīm |\nayuktaḥ kāmakāreṇa phale sakto nibadhyate ||",
  "translation": "The united one (the yogi), having abandoned the fruits of action, attains eternal peace. The non-united one, attached to results through desire-prompted action, becomes bound.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a clear contrast between the liberated yogi and the bound individual. The yukta (one who is united or disciplined in yoga) performs actions but renounces all attachment to their fruits, thereby attaining naiṣṭhikī śānti—supreme, eternal peace that is firmly established and unshakeable. This peace is not temporary or conditional but represents the permanent state of inner tranquility that comes from selfless action performed as an offering to the Divine.\n\nIn stark contrast, the ayukta (one who is not united in yoga) acts out of kāma (desire) and remains attached to the fruits of action. Such a person becomes bound (nibadhyate) by the karmic consequences of their actions. This bondage perpetuates the cycle of birth and death (saṃsāra) because actions performed with selfish motives create karmic impressions that must be worked out through future experiences. The verse emphasizes that it is not action itself that binds, but rather the attachment to results and the desire-driven motivation behind actions.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Karma Yoga philosophy expounded in this chapter. Krishna is showing Arjuna that true freedom comes not from abandoning action, but from abandoning attachment to the results of action. The disciplined yogi who performs duty without expectation achieves liberation while remaining active in the world, whereas the desire-driven individual remains trapped despite their efforts.",
