  "transliteration": "iti guhyatamaṁ śāstram idam uktaṁ mayānagha |\netad buddhvā buddhimān syāt kṛta-kṛtyaś ca bhārata ||",
  "translation": "Thus this most secret scripture has been taught by Me, O sinless one. Understanding this, one becomes wise and accomplishes all that needs to be accomplished, O descendant of Bharata.",
  "commentary": "In this concluding verse of Chapter 15, Krishna summarizes the profound teaching of the Purushottama Yoga. He declares this knowledge to be 'guhyatamam' - the most secret or confidential of all scriptures. This supreme wisdom concerns the distinction between the perishable (kshara), imperishable (akshara), and the Supreme Person (Purushottama) who transcends both. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'anagha' (sinless), indicating that one who receives this knowledge with devotion is purified of all sins.\n\nThe verse promises two significant results for one who truly understands this teaching: becoming 'buddhiman' (wise or enlightened) and 'krita-kritya' (one who has accomplished all that needs to be accomplished). This indicates that understanding the nature of the Supreme Person and one's relationship with Him constitutes the ultimate purpose of human existence. Once this knowledge is realized, there remains nothing further to be achieved, as the soul attains complete fulfillment and liberation. This verse serves as a bridge to the next chapter, which will elaborate on the divine and demoniac natures, building upon the foundation of understanding the Supreme Person established here.",
