  "transliteration": "yasya sarve samārambhāḥ kāma-saṅkalpa-varjitāḥ |\njñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇaṁ tam āhuḥ paṇḍitaṁ budhāḥ ||19||",
  "translation": "One whose every undertaking is free from desire and selfish motive, whose actions have been burned in the fire of knowledge—such a person is called wise by the learned.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of a truly wise person (pandita). The defining quality is that all their actions (sarve samārambhāḥ) are devoid of desire (kāma) and selfish intention (saṅkalpa). This does not mean the person ceases to act, but rather that their actions are performed without attachment to personal gain or ego-driven motives. The verse emphasizes that such a person's karmas have been 'burned' (dagdha) by the fire of knowledge (jñānāgni), meaning that self-knowledge has destroyed the binding power of actions.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the concept of karma-yoga presented in Chapter 4. The 'fire of knowledge' refers to the realization of one's true nature as the eternal Self (Ātman), distinct from the body-mind complex that performs actions. When this knowledge dawns, actions no longer create karmic bondage because they are performed without the sense of doership or expectation of results. The wise (budhāḥ) recognize such a person as truly learned (paṇḍita) because external scholarship alone does not constitute wisdom—it is the practical application of knowledge in daily life that marks true understanding. This verse bridges the concepts of karma (action), jñāna (knowledge), and sannyāsa (renunciation), showing that true renunciation is internal rather than merely external abandonment of action.",
