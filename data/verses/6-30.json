  "commentary": "This verse represents one of the most profound declarations in the Bhagavad Gita regarding the relationship between the devotee and the Divine. Krishna describes the state of a perfected yogi who has attained the vision of unity—one who perceives the Divine presence pervading all existence and simultaneously sees all existence resting within the Divine. This is the culmination of the meditation practices described earlier in this chapter, where the yogi transcends dualistic perception and realizes the non-dual reality.\n\nThe reciprocal nature of this relationship is particularly significant. Krishna assures that for one who has achieved this universal vision, there is an eternal, unbreakable bond. The phrase 'I am never lost to him, nor is he ever lost to Me' indicates that this is not merely a philosophical understanding but a living, experiential reality that transforms the yogi's entire existence. This mutual indwelling represents the highest state of yoga—complete union with the Divine. The yogi who sees with this vision has transcended the limitations of individual ego-consciousness and abides in the awareness of the Supreme Self in all beings and all beings in the Supreme Self.\n\nThis verse also provides great assurance and encouragement to spiritual aspirants. It promises that once this vision is attained, even partially, the connection with the Divine becomes permanent and irreversible. The relationship is not dependent on external circumstances or temporary states of mind, but is rooted in the fundamental reality of existence itself. This teaching forms the foundation for the practice of seeing God in all beings, which Krishna will elaborate upon in the following verses.",
