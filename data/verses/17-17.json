  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Three Divisions of Faith",
  "sanskrit": "श्रद्धया परया तप्तं तपस्तत्त्रिविधं नरैः।\nअफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्युक्तैः सात्त्विकं परिचक्षते॥",
  "transliteration": "śraddhayā parayā taptaṁ tapas tat trividhaṁ naraiḥ |\naphalākāṅkṣibhir yuktaiḥ sāttvikaṁ paricakṣate ||",
  "translation": "This threefold austerity, practiced with supreme faith by steadfast individuals who desire no fruit, is said to be sattvic (pure).",
  "commentary": "This verse concludes the discussion on the threefold classification of austerity (tapas) by defining what makes austerity sattvic in nature. Krishna emphasizes that the quality of austerity is not determined solely by the practices themselves, but by the attitude and motivation with which they are performed. The key characteristics of sattvic austerity are supreme faith (paraya shraddha), steadfastness (yukta), and freedom from desire for results (aphala-akanksha).\n\nThe threefold austerity mentioned here refers to the physical, verbal, and mental austerities described in the previous three verses. When these practices are performed with deep faith in the scriptures and the spiritual path, by individuals who are balanced and disciplined, and without any expectation of worldly rewards or recognition, they purify the mind and lead to spiritual advancement. This is in stark contrast to rajasic austerity performed for gaining respect or power, and tamasic austerity performed with self-torture or harmful intentions.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that spiritual practices derive their value from the purity of intention behind them. The same external practice can be sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic depending on the practitioner's motivation. This verse establishes the gold standard for all spiritual disciplines: they must be performed with faith, without attachment to results, and with inner stability. This teaching aligns with the central message of the Gita regarding nishkama karma (desireless action) and emphasizes that true spiritual progress comes from inner purity rather than mere external observances.",
