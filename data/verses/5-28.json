  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Renunciation of Action",
  "sanskrit": "यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिर्मुनिर्मोक्षपरायणः ।\nविगतेच्छाभयक्रोधो यः सदा मुक्त एव सः ॥",
  "transliteration": "yatendriya-mano-buddhir munir mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ |\nvigatecchā-bhaya-krodho yaḥ sadā mukta eva saḥ ||",
  "translation": "The sage who has controlled the senses, mind, and intellect, who is devoted to liberation, and who is free from desire, fear, and anger—such a person is forever liberated.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of a liberated sage (muni) who has attained the highest state of spiritual freedom. Krishna outlines the essential qualities: complete mastery over the senses (indriya), mind (manas), and intellect (buddhi); unwavering dedication to liberation (moksha-parayana); and freedom from the three primary obstacles to spiritual progress—desire (iccha), fear (bhaya), and anger (krodha). The verse emphasizes that such a person is 'sadā mukta'—eternally or always liberated—indicating that this freedom is not a future attainment but a present reality.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 5, which explores the relationship between renunciation and action, this verse serves as a bridge to the concluding teachings. It demonstrates that true renunciation is not merely external withdrawal from action, but an internal state of freedom achieved through self-mastery. The sage described here embodies the ideal of karma-sannyasa, having transcended the binding effects of action through complete equanimity and detachment. This verse, along with the following ones, prepares the ground for the meditation techniques that will be elaborated in subsequent chapters, showing that liberation is accessible to those who cultivate these qualities through dedicated practice and discrimination.",
