  "translation": "One must elevate oneself by one's own mind, and not degrade oneself. The mind alone is the friend of the self, and the mind alone is the enemy of the self.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most profound teachings of the Bhagavad Gita regarding self-responsibility and the dual nature of the mind. Krishna emphasizes that each individual is solely responsible for their own spiritual upliftment or downfall. The mind (ātman in its lower sense) can be either one's greatest ally or worst enemy, depending on whether it is controlled or uncontrolled. When disciplined through yoga and meditation, the mind becomes a friend that leads one toward liberation; when left uncontrolled and dominated by desires and passions, it becomes an enemy that drags one into bondage.\n\nThis teaching is central to the theme of Dhyana Yoga, as it establishes the importance of self-effort in spiritual practice. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that meditation and self-control are not external impositions but internal disciplines that one must willingly undertake. The verse refutes any notion of fatalism or dependence on external forces alone for spiritual progress. It places the power and responsibility squarely in the hands of the practitioner, emphasizing that through proper training and discipline of the mind, one can achieve the highest spiritual goals. This self-reliant approach to spirituality is a cornerstone of the Gita's practical philosophy.",
