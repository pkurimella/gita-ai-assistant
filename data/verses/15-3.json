  "sanskrit": "न रूपमस्येह तथोपलभ्यते नान्तो न चादिर्न च सम्प्रतिष्ठा ।\nअश्वत्थमेनं सुविरूढमूलमसङ्गशस्त्रेण दृढेन छित्त्वा ॥",
  "transliteration": "na rūpam asyeha tathopalabhyate nānto na cādir na ca sampratiṣṭhā |\naśvattham enaṁ suvirūḍha-mūlam asaṅga-śastreṇa dṛḍhena chittvā ||",
  "translation": "The true form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world, nor its end, nor its beginning, nor its foundation. Having cut down this firmly rooted ashvattha tree with the strong axe of non-attachment...",
  "commentary": "This verse continues the metaphor of the ashvattha tree (the cosmic tree of samsara) introduced in the previous verses. Krishna explains that the true nature of this tree of worldly existence cannot be fully comprehended through ordinary perception. Its form, beginning, end, and foundation remain elusive to those caught in the web of material existence. This emphasizes the illusory and complex nature of samsara, which keeps beings bound through ignorance.\n\nThe solution Krishna offers is radical: one must cut down this tree with the 'axe of non-attachment' (asaṅga-śastra). This is not a physical act but a spiritual practice of developing vairāgya (dispassion) toward worldly objects and relationships. The tree is described as 'suvirūḍha-mūla' (deeply rooted), indicating that desires and attachments have penetrated deep into the consciousness through countless lifetimes. Therefore, the axe must be 'dṛḍha' (strong and sharp), meaning one's detachment must be firm and unwavering. This verse teaches that liberation requires a decisive break from the patterns of attachment that perpetuate the cycle of birth and death, and this can only be achieved through cultivating profound non-attachment to the fruits of action and the objects of the senses.",
