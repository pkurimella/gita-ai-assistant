  "translation": "O Partha (Arjuna), happy are the warriors who obtain such a battle, which comes unsought and opens the gates of heaven for them.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the warrior's perspective on righteous battle, emphasizing the fortune of those who encounter such an opportunity. He describes this war as arriving 'yadṛcchayā' (unsought or by chance), meaning it has come to Arjuna without his seeking it out. The phrase 'svarga-dvāram apāvṛtam' (the open gates of heaven) indicates that fighting in a righteous war is considered a direct path to heavenly realms according to the dharma of the Kshatriya class.\n\nKrishna is appealing to Arjuna's sense of duty and fortune as a warrior. He suggests that such an opportunity for righteous battle is rare and blessed, something that warriors pray for. The verse emphasizes that only fortunate (sukhinaḥ) Kshatriyas get such a chance to fulfill their dharma in its highest form. This is part of Krishna's multi-layered argument, where he addresses Arjuna from different philosophical and practical standpoints.\n\nThis verse must be understood in the context of the entire chapter, where Krishna is systematically dismantling Arjuna's arguments for not fighting. Here, he appeals to the warrior code and the concept of svadharma (one's own duty). The verse reflects the ancient Indian worldview where performing one's prescribed duty, especially in a just cause, was considered the highest virtue and a means to spiritual elevation.",
