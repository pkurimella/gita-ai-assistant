  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Division of the Three Gunas",
  "sanskrit": "यदा सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे तु प्रलयं याति देहभृत्।\nतदोत्तमविदां लोकानमलान्प्रतिपद्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu pralayaṁ yāti deha-bhṛt |\ntadottama-vidāṁ lokān amalān pratipadyate ||",
  "translation": "When one dies during the predominance of sattva (goodness), one attains to the pure worlds of the knowers of the Highest.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the destination of a soul that departs from the body when sattva guna is predominant. Krishna explains that such a person reaches the 'amalān lokān' (spotless or pure worlds) of those who know the Supreme Truth. These are the higher celestial realms inhabited by sages, seers, and enlightened beings who have attained spiritual wisdom. The term 'uttama-vidām' refers to those who possess knowledge of the highest reality.\n\nThis verse is part of Krishna's systematic explanation of how the three gunas influence not only one's life but also one's destination after death. The predominance of sattva at the time of death indicates a life lived with purity, knowledge, and spiritual discipline. The pure worlds mentioned here are intermediate stations on the spiritual journey, though not the ultimate liberation (moksha). These realms offer opportunities for further spiritual evolution in conducive environments.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that our mental state and the predominant guna at death are not arbitrary but are the culmination of our life's tendencies and practices. This verse encourages spiritual seekers to cultivate sattva through righteous living, self-control, and pursuit of knowledge, so that even if final liberation is not achieved, one progresses to higher realms conducive to spiritual advancement.",
