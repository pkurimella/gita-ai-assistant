  "translation": "O Janardana (Krishna), we have heard that those men who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to articulate his moral dilemma by citing traditional teachings he has learned. He addresses Krishna as Janardana (one who moves or agitates people) and expresses his concern about the consequences of destroying family dharma. Arjuna has been taught that those who cause the breakdown of family traditions are destined to suffer in hell indefinitely. This reflects the traditional Hindu belief in the importance of maintaining family customs and the severe karmic consequences of their destruction.\n\nArjuna's argument reveals his deep conditioning by social and religious norms. He is genuinely concerned that by fighting this war and killing his kinsmen, he will be responsible for the collapse of family structures and religious practices. This would lead not only to his own damnation but also to the spiritual degradation of countless souls. The verse demonstrates Arjuna's sincere attempt to avoid sin and his reliance on scriptural authority and traditional wisdom. However, this understanding is incomplete and based on a limited perspective that Krishna will later expand upon, teaching him about the immortality of the soul and the true nature of dharma beyond mere social convention.",
