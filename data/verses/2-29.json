  "translation": "One sees the Self as a wonder, another speaks of It as a wonder, still another hears of It as a wonder, yet even after hearing, no one truly knows It.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the extraordinary and mysterious nature of the eternal Self (Ātman). He describes how different people relate to this profound truth in different ways—some perceive it with amazement, some describe it with awe, and some listen to teachings about it with wonder. Yet despite all these encounters with the knowledge of the Self, very few actually realize its true nature experientially. This verse echoes the Kaṭha Upaniṣad's teaching about the rarity and difficulty of Self-realization.\n\nThe verse serves as a culmination of Krishna's teaching about the imperishable nature of the Ātman in this chapter. It explains why Arjuna and most people struggle with understanding the immortality of the Self—it is not merely an intellectual concept but a profound truth that transcends ordinary comprehension. The wonder (āścarya) mentioned here indicates that the Self cannot be grasped through conventional means of knowledge alone; it requires direct spiritual experience and realization.\n\nThis teaching prepares the ground for Krishna's subsequent instruction about performing one's duty without attachment. By establishing that the Self is beyond ordinary understanding and truly imperishable, Krishna removes the basis for Arjuna's grief about killing his relatives in battle. The verse also highlights the importance of having a qualified teacher and the grace required for true spiritual understanding, as mere hearing or intellectual study is insufficient for complete realization.",
