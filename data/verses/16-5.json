  "sanskrit": "दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय निबन्धायासुरी मता।\nमा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव॥",

  "translation": "The divine qualities lead to liberation, while the demoniac qualities lead to bondage. Do not grieve, O Arjuna, for you are born with divine qualities.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides a clear distinction between the ultimate outcomes of divine (daivi) and demoniac (asuri) qualities. The divine qualities enumerated in the previous verses lead to moksha or liberation from the cycle of birth and death, while the demoniac qualities bind one further to material existence and suffering. This establishes the fundamental purpose of cultivating divine qualities—they are not merely ethical guidelines but pathways to spiritual freedom.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna affectionately as 'Pandava' and reassures him not to grieve or worry, declaring that Arjuna is born with divine qualities. This reassurance is significant in the context of Arjuna's earlier despair at the beginning of the Gita. Krishna is affirming that Arjuna's compassion, his moral concerns, and his seeking of guidance are all signs of divine nature. The Lord's statement serves to encourage Arjuna and all spiritual seekers that possessing divine qualities is their true nature and birthright.\n\nThis verse serves as a transitional point in the chapter. Having described divine qualities extensively, Krishna now begins to contrast them with demoniac qualities in subsequent verses. The assurance to Arjuna also carries a universal message: those who sincerely seek spiritual knowledge and are concerned about dharma naturally possess divine qualities, regardless of their temporary confusion or difficulties. The verse emphasizes that spiritual evolution is the natural outcome of cultivating divine virtues.",
