  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Division of the Three Gunas",
  "sanskrit": "सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणाः प्रकृतिसम्भवाः।\nनिबध्नन्ति महाबाहो देहे देहिनमव्ययम्॥",
  "transliteration": "sattvaṁ rajas tama iti guṇāḥ prakṛti-sambhavāḥ |\nnibadhanti mahā-bāho dehe dehinam avyayam ||",
  "translation": "Sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance) - these qualities born of Prakriti (material nature) bind the imperishable embodied soul to the body, O mighty-armed Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces the fundamental teaching of Chapter 14 by naming the three gunas and explaining their binding effect on the eternal soul. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'mighty-armed' (mahā-bāho) while explaining how even the imperishable, unchanging soul (dehinam avyayam) becomes bound by these three modes of material nature. The paradox presented here is profound: though the soul is eternal and indestructible, it becomes conditioned and limited through its association with these three qualities that arise from Prakriti.\n\nThe three gunas - sattva (purity, knowledge, harmony), rajas (passion, activity, desire), and tamas (darkness, inertia, ignorance) - are not merely abstract philosophical concepts but active forces that shape human consciousness, behavior, and destiny. They originate from Prakriti, the material energy, and create the conditioning that causes the soul to identify with the body and mind. This identification leads to the cycle of birth and death, as the soul forgets its true nature and becomes entangled in material existence. Understanding how these gunas operate is essential for spiritual liberation, which is why Krishna devotes this entire chapter to their detailed explanation.",
