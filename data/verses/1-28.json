  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection",
  "sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nदृष्ट्वेमं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम्।\nसीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति॥",
  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\ndṛṣṭvemaṁ svajanaṁ kṛṣṇa yuyutsuṁ samupasthitam |\nsīdanti mama gātrāṇi mukhaṁ ca pariśuṣyati ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Krishna, seeing these my kinsmen assembled here eager to fight, my limbs fail and my mouth is parched.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial turning point in the narrative as Arjuna begins to express his emotional and physical response to the impending battle. After surveying both armies and recognizing his relatives, teachers, and friends on both sides, Arjuna experiences the onset of profound grief and moral confusion. His physical symptoms—weakening limbs and a dry mouth—are manifestations of his inner turmoil and represent the beginning of his complete breakdown on the battlefield.\n\nArjuna's condition is significant because it represents the universal human dilemma when faced with conflicting duties and emotional attachments. His address to Krishna as 'Kṛṣṇa' is intimate and personal, showing his dependence on his friend and charioteer for support in this moment of crisis. The verse captures the transition from a warrior's confidence to human vulnerability, setting the stage for Krishna's teachings. The physical symptoms described—sīdanti (sinking/failing) of limbs and pariśuṣyati (complete drying) of mouth—are classical signs of extreme anxiety and fear in Sanskrit literature, indicating that even the mighty warrior Arjuna is not immune to human weakness when confronted with the prospect of killing his own kin.",
