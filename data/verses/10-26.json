  "translation": "Among all trees I am the sacred fig tree (Ashvattha); among the divine sages I am Narada; among the Gandharvas I am Chitraratha; and among the perfected beings I am the sage Kapila.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations by identifying Himself with the most excellent representatives of various categories. The Ashvattha (sacred fig or peepal tree) is considered the most sacred among trees in Vedic tradition, symbolizing eternal life as its roots grow upward and branches downward, representing the inverted tree of material existence mentioned in Chapter 15. Among divine sages (devarshis), Narada is supreme as the celestial messenger who travels between worlds spreading devotion and divine knowledge.\n\nChitraratha is the chief of the Gandharvas, celestial musicians who entertain the gods with their artistic excellence. Kapila Muni represents the perfected sages (siddhas) and is renowned as the founder of the Sankhya philosophy, one of the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy. By identifying with Kapila, Krishna acknowledges the importance of discriminative knowledge and philosophical inquiry in spiritual evolution. Each of these manifestations represents the pinnacle of excellence in their respective domains, teaching that the divine can be recognized through supreme qualities and achievements.\n\nThis verse emphasizes that wherever there is exceptional excellence, beauty, power, or wisdom, it is a reflection of the Divine. The progression from natural objects (trees) to celestial beings (divine sages and Gandharvas) to perfected human sages shows that divine manifestation exists at all levels of creation, encouraging seekers to recognize the sacred in both nature and enlightened beings.",
