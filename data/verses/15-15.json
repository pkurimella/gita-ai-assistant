  "sanskrit": "सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो मत्तः स्मृतिर्ज्ञानमपोहनं च। वेदैश्च सर्वैरहमेव वेद्यो वेदान्तकृद्वेदविदेव चाहम्॥",
  "transliteration": "sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca | vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham ||",
  "translation": "I am seated in the hearts of all beings. From Me come memory, knowledge, and their loss. I alone am to be known through all the Vedas; I am indeed the author of Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna reveals His omnipresence and supreme authority as the indwelling Self in all beings. He declares that He resides in the heart (hṛdaya) of every creature as the witness consciousness, and that all cognitive functions—memory (smṛti), knowledge (jñāna), and even forgetfulness (apohana)—originate from Him. This establishes Krishna as the ultimate source and controller of all mental faculties, emphasizing that nothing occurs without His sanction as the inner controller (antaryāmin).\n\nThe second half of the verse addresses the purpose and culmination of all Vedic knowledge. Krishna asserts that He alone is the ultimate object of knowledge that all the Vedas seek to reveal. He identifies Himself as both the creator of Vedanta (the concluding portions of the Vedas, the Upanishads) and as the true knower of the Vedas. This declaration places Krishna at the center of all spiritual knowledge and practice, indicating that the entire Vedic tradition points toward realizing Him as the Supreme Reality.\n\nThis verse is crucial in establishing the Puruṣottama (Supreme Person) as both immanent and transcendent—dwelling within all hearts while simultaneously being the ultimate goal of all knowledge. It bridges the personal and impersonal aspects of the Divine, showing that the Supreme Being is both intimately present in every heart and the highest truth to be realized through scriptural study and spiritual practice.",
