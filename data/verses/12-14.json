  "sanskrit": "सन्तुष्टः सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चयः।\nमय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः॥",
  "transliteration": "santuṣṭaḥ satataṁ yogī yatātmā dṛḍhaniścayaḥ |\nmayyarpitamanobuddhiryo madbhaktaḥ sa me priyaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Ever content, steadfast in meditation, self-controlled, possessed of firm conviction, with mind and intellect dedicated to Me—such a devotee of Mine is dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to describe the qualities of His ideal devotee. The verse emphasizes four key characteristics: contentment (santuṣṭa), constant practice of yoga (satataṁ yogī), self-mastery (yatātmā), and unwavering determination (dṛḍhaniścaya). These qualities form the foundation of spiritual practice, showing that true devotion requires both inner discipline and outer stability. The contentment mentioned here is not complacency but a deep satisfaction that comes from spiritual practice, independent of external circumstances.\n\nThe second half of the verse reveals the culminating quality: complete surrender of mind and intellect to the Divine. When a devotee offers both manas (the emotional mind) and buddhi (the discriminating intellect) to Krishna, they achieve total integration of their being in devotion. This is not blind faith but an intelligent, wholehearted commitment born of understanding and experience. The phrase 'sa me priyaḥ' (dear to Me) appears repeatedly in this chapter, emphasizing that these qualities naturally attract divine grace. This verse bridges the gap between the path of knowledge and devotion, showing that true bhakti requires disciplined practice, self-control, and the complete offering of one's faculties to the Supreme.",
