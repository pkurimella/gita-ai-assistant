  "transliteration": "jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā kūṭastho vijitendriyaḥ |\nyukta ity ucyate yogī sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ ||",
  "translation": "One whose soul is satisfied with knowledge and wisdom, who remains unchanging, who has conquered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a stone, and gold are the same—such a yogi is said to be established in union (yukta).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of a yogi who has attained the state of perfect union or yoga. Krishna outlines four essential qualities: first, the yogi is satisfied (tṛpta) through both jñāna (theoretical knowledge of the Self) and vijñāna (experiential realization or wisdom). This satisfaction comes from within, not from external objects or circumstances. Second, the yogi is kūṭastha, meaning unchanging or immovable like an anvil, remaining steady amidst all circumstances. Third, such a person has complete mastery over the senses (vijitendriya), no longer being swayed by sensory attractions or aversions.\n\nThe fourth characteristic—sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcana—is particularly significant. The yogi views a clod of earth, a stone, and gold with equal vision, not because they lack discrimination, but because they have transcended the dualistic perception of value based on material utility. This equanimity arises from the realization that all objects are temporary manifestations of the same ultimate Reality. This verse builds upon the earlier teachings in this chapter about meditation and self-control, showing that true yoga is not merely a technique but a state of being characterized by inner fulfillment, stability, sensory mastery, and equal vision. Such a person is truly 'yukta'—united with the Divine and established in the highest state of consciousness.",
