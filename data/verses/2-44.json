  "translation": "For those whose minds are carried away by the flowery words (of the Vedas), who are deeply attached to sense pleasures and worldly power, and whose discrimination has been stolen away by such teachings—the resolute determination of samadhi (absorption in the Self) is not formed in their minds.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his critique of those who are overly attached to the ritualistic portions of the Vedas. He explains that people whose consciousness is captivated by promises of heavenly pleasures and material prosperity cannot develop the steady, focused intellect necessary for Self-realization. Their minds, being scattered among various desires for enjoyment (bhoga) and power (aiśvarya), lack the single-pointed determination (vyavasāyātmikā buddhi) that was praised in the previous verse.\n\nThe phrase 'tayāpahṛta-cetasām' (those whose minds have been stolen away) is particularly significant. It suggests that attachment to sensory pleasures and worldly achievements actually robs one of discriminative wisdom. When the intellect is fragmented by multiple desires and goals, it cannot achieve the concentrated focus required for samadhi—the state of meditative absorption where one realizes the true nature of the Self. This verse emphasizes that spiritual progress requires not just knowledge of scriptures, but a fundamental reorientation away from sense gratification toward Self-knowledge.\n\nKrishna's teaching here is crucial for understanding the distinction between karma-kāṇḍa (ritualistic action for results) and jñāna-yoga (the path of knowledge). Those seeking material rewards through religious practices remain bound to the cycle of desire and action, while those who cultivate detachment and single-pointed focus can attain the higher goal of liberation. This verse serves as a warning against mistaking religious materialism for genuine spiritual practice.",
