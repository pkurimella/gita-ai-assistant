  "translation": "O son of Kunti, I am the taste in water, I am the light in the moon and the sun, I am the sacred syllable Om in all the Vedas, I am the sound in ether, and I am the ability in human beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins to reveal how He pervades all of creation through His various manifestations. He identifies Himself with the essential qualities and characteristics that make each element and entity what it is. The taste (rasa) in water represents the fundamental quality that makes water desirable and life-sustaining. The light in the sun and moon represents the illuminating principle that dispels darkness. The pranava (Om) in the Vedas represents the primordial sound from which all creation emanates and the essence of all Vedic knowledge.\n\nKrishna further identifies Himself as sound in ether (space), which is the subtle element from which all grosser elements emerge according to Vedic cosmology. Finally, He declares Himself to be 'paurusham' - the essential human capacity, vigor, or ability in men. This verse illustrates the immanent aspect of the Divine - God is not separate from creation but is the very essence that gives each thing its distinctive nature and function. By recognizing the Divine in these fundamental aspects of existence, a spiritual seeker can develop constant God-consciousness in daily life, seeing the sacred in the ordinary and transforming every experience into an opportunity for divine remembrance.",
