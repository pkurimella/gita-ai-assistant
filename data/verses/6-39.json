  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna concludes his inquiry about the fate of the unsuccessful yogi with a humble and earnest appeal to Krishna. Having expressed his concern about a person who begins the path of yoga with faith but fails to achieve perfection due to the mind wandering away, Arjuna now requests Krishna to completely remove his doubt. The word 'aśeṣataḥ' (completely, without remainder) indicates Arjuna's desire for a thorough and definitive answer that leaves no room for confusion.\n\nArjuna's statement that no one other than Krishna can dispel this doubt reveals his complete faith in Krishna as the supreme authority on spiritual matters. This verse demonstrates the proper attitude of a sincere seeker—recognizing one's own limitations in understanding profound spiritual truths and approaching the guru or the Divine with humility and surrender. The doubt Arjuna raises is not merely personal but universal, concerning all spiritual aspirants who fear that their efforts might be wasted if they cannot complete the spiritual journey in one lifetime.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for Krishna's reassuring response in the following verses, where He will explain the doctrine of spiritual evolution across lifetimes and assure that no sincere effort on the spiritual path is ever lost. The question reflects a fundamental concern in spiritual practice: the fear of failure and the anxiety about the ultimate fate of one's spiritual endeavors.",
