  "transliteration": "api ced asi pāpebhyaḥ sarvebhyaḥ pāpa-kṛttamaḥ |\nsarvaṁ jñāna-plavenaiva vṛjinaṁ santariṣyasi ||36||",
  "translation": "Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, you shall cross over all sin by the raft of knowledge alone.",
  "commentary": "In this powerful verse, Krishna emphasizes the supreme purifying power of spiritual knowledge (jñāna). He assures that even the greatest sinner can transcend all accumulated sins through the acquisition of true knowledge. The metaphor of a raft (plava) is particularly significant—just as a raft carries one across turbulent waters to the other shore, spiritual wisdom carries the seeker across the ocean of worldly existence and karmic bondage, regardless of past transgressions.\n\nThis verse comes in the context of Krishna's discourse on jñāna-yoga and follows his explanation of how knowledge destroys all karmas. The statement is unconditional and absolute—there is no sin too great that cannot be overcome by the purifying fire of knowledge. This reflects the Gita's optimistic and inclusive philosophy that liberation is available to all, regardless of their past. The use of the superlative 'pāpa-kṛttamaḥ' (most sinful) emphasizes that no one is beyond redemption through spiritual knowledge.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in establishing knowledge as the ultimate purifier and liberator. This verse provides hope and encouragement to spiritual aspirants who may feel burdened by past mistakes. It reinforces the central theme of Chapter 4 that true knowledge of the Self and reality has transformative power that transcends all karmic limitations and moral imperfections, leading one to the supreme goal of liberation.",
