  "sanskrit": "आत्मसम्भाविताः स्तब्धा धनमानमदान्विताः।\nयजन्ते नामयज्ञैस्ते दम्भेनाविधिपूर्वकम्॥",
  "transliteration": "ātma-sambhāvitāḥ stabdhā dhana-māna-madānvitāḥ |\nyajante nāma-yajñais te dambhenāvidhi-pūrvakam ||",
  "translation": "Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride and arrogance of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name only, with ostentation and without following scriptural injunctions.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of those possessed of demoniac qualities. Such individuals are characterized by excessive self-importance (ātma-sambhāvitāḥ), being completely absorbed in their own imagined greatness. They are stubborn and rigid (stabdhā) in their false convictions, intoxicated by wealth and the honor they believe it brings them. Their pride (māna) and arrogance (mada) arising from material possessions completely cloud their discrimination.\n\nThe verse particularly highlights their hypocritical religious practices. Though they may perform sacrifices and rituals, these are merely for show (dambha) - done to gain social recognition and prestige rather than for spiritual advancement. They conduct these ceremonies in name only (nāma-yajña), without understanding or following the proper scriptural procedures (avidhi-pūrvakam). Such ostentatious displays of religiosity without genuine devotion or adherence to dharmic principles are worthless and even harmful, as they perpetuate ego and delusion rather than dissolving them.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in understanding how spiritual practices can be corrupted when performed with the wrong motivation. Krishna emphasizes that true spiritual practice requires humility, proper knowledge, and sincere intention - qualities completely absent in those of demoniac nature who use religion merely as another arena for displaying their wealth and feeding their ego.",
