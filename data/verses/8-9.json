  "transliteration": "kaviṁ purāṇam anuśāsitāram aṇor aṇīyāṁsam anusmared yaḥ |\nsarvasya dhātāram acintya-rūpam āditya-varṇaṁ tamasaḥ parastāt ||",
  "translation": "One should meditate on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler, subtler than the subtlest, the Sustainer of all, whose form is inconceivable, who is luminous like the sun, and beyond all darkness.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides a detailed description of the Supreme Being upon whom one should meditate at the time of death. The Lord is described through multiple attributes: He is the kavi (omniscient seer-poet) who knows all things past, present, and future; He is purāṇa (ancient, primordial), existing before all creation; He is the anuśāsitā (ruler and controller) who governs the cosmic order through natural laws. Despite being the supreme controller, He is subtler than the atom (aṇor aṇīyāṁsam), pervading everything yet remaining imperceptible to ordinary senses.\n\nThe verse continues by describing the Lord as the dhātā (sustainer and supporter) of all existence, whose true form (acintya-rūpa) is beyond the grasp of the material mind and intellect. He is compared to the sun (āditya-varṇa) in His self-luminous nature, being the source of all light and consciousness. Most significantly, He is described as existing beyond all darkness (tamasaḥ parastāt), transcending ignorance, material nature, and all limitations. This comprehensive description serves as a meditation object for the spiritual aspirant, particularly at the crucial moment of death, helping to fix the mind on the Supreme Reality and thereby attain liberation.",
