  "sanskrit": "ततः शङ्खाश्च भेर्यश्च पणवानकगोमुखाः।\nसहसैवाभ्यहन्यन्त स शब्दस्तुमुलोऽभवत्॥",
  "transliteration": "tataḥ śaṅkhāś ca bheryaś ca paṇavānaka-gomukhāḥ|\nsahasaivābhyahanyanta sa śabdas tumulo 'bhavat||",
  "translation": "Then conches, kettledrums, tabors, drums and horns suddenly blared forth, and that sound became tumultuous.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the immediate response of the Pandava army to Bhishma's conch blast. Following the challenge issued by the grandsire of the Kurus, the Pandava forces respond with a tremendous cacophony of their own war instruments. The verse lists five types of musical instruments - conches (śaṅkha), kettledrums (bherī), tabors (paṇava), drums (ānaka), and horns (gomukha) - all sounding simultaneously to create a tumultuous roar.\n\nThe word 'sahasā' (suddenly) indicates the spontaneous and immediate nature of this response, showing the readiness and enthusiasm of the Pandava army. This is not a hesitant or delayed reaction, but an instant and powerful counter-challenge. The description of the sound as 'tumula' (tumultuous or overwhelming) emphasizes the magnitude and intensity of the response, suggesting that the Pandava forces were equally formidable and not intimidated by Bhishma's challenge. This verse continues to build the dramatic tension on the battlefield, setting the stage for the personal crisis that Arjuna will soon experience. The escalating sounds of war instruments from both sides create an atmosphere of imminent conflict, making Arjuna's subsequent reluctance to fight even more poignant and significant.",
