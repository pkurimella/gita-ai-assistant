  "transliteration": "paśyādityān vasūn rudrān aśvinau marutas tathā |\nbahūny adṛṣṭa-pūrvāṇi paśyāścaryāṇi bhārata ||6||",
  "translation": "Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Ashvins, and the Maruts. Behold many wonders never seen before, O descendant of Bharata.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna invites Arjuna to witness the cosmic vision He is about to reveal. He enumerates various classes of celestial beings that Arjuna will behold in the Vishvarupa (Universal Form): the twelve Adityas (solar deities), the eight Vasus (elemental gods), the eleven Rudras (forms of Shiva), the twin Ashvins (divine physicians), and the forty-nine Maruts (storm gods). These represent different categories of divine beings that govern various aspects of cosmic functioning.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that Arjuna will witness countless marvels that have never been seen before by anyone. This indicates the unprecedented nature of the vision about to be granted. The Universal Form is not merely a collection of deities, but a complete revelation of the infinite manifestations of the Divine, encompassing all of creation, preservation, and dissolution. This verse builds anticipation for the extraordinary theophany that follows, preparing Arjuna (and the reader) for a vision that transcends ordinary human perception and understanding.\n\nBy addressing Arjuna as 'Bharata' (descendant of Bharata), Krishna reminds him of his noble lineage and his capacity to receive this supreme vision. This divine revelation is granted not just for Arjuna's personal enlightenment, but represents a pivotal moment in spiritual history where the Absolute reveals itself in its totality to a human being, demonstrating that the Divine encompasses all forms, beings, and phenomena in the universe.",
