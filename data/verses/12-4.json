  "translation": "Those who fully control their senses, remain even-minded everywhere, and are engaged in the welfare of all beings—they also attain Me alone.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His response to Arjuna's question about the relative merits of worshipping the manifest versus the unmanifest. Here He describes the characteristics and attainment of those who worship the imperishable, unmanifest Absolute. Such practitioners must exercise complete control over their senses (saṁniyamyendriyagrāmam), maintain equanimity in all circumstances (sarvatra samabuddhayaḥ), and dedicate themselves to the welfare of all beings (sarvabhūtahite ratāḥ).\n\nThe verse emphasizes that despite the different paths—whether devotion to the personal form or meditation on the impersonal Absolute—the ultimate destination is the same: union with the Supreme. However, Krishna is establishing that the path of the unmanifest requires extraordinary discipline, complete sensory control, and perfect equanimity. The inclusion of 'sarvabhūtahite ratāḥ' (engaged in the welfare of all beings) indicates that true spiritual realization cannot be divorced from compassionate action in the world. This verse bridges the understanding that both saguna (with attributes) and nirguna (without attributes) approaches lead to the same Supreme Reality, though the paths differ in their practical application and difficulty.",
