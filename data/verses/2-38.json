  "commentary": "This pivotal verse marks Krishna's transition from Sāṅkhya philosophy to Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action. Krishna instructs Arjuna to perform his duty as a warrior with complete equanimity, remaining unaffected by the dualities of existence—pleasure and pain, profit and loss, success and failure. This teaching establishes the foundation of Nishkama Karma (desireless action), where one acts without attachment to results.\n\nThe verse addresses Arjuna's moral dilemma about fighting in the war. Krishna clarifies that action performed with equanimity and without selfish desire does not bind one to karmic consequences or sin (pāpa). The key is not the action itself, but the mental state and intention behind it. When one acts as an instrument of dharma, maintaining inner balance regardless of outcomes, the action becomes a form of yoga—a means of spiritual evolution rather than bondage.\n\nThis teaching has profound implications beyond the battlefield, applicable to all aspects of life. It advocates performing one's duty with full commitment while maintaining psychological detachment from results. This balanced approach prevents both the paralysis of inaction (which Arjuna was experiencing) and the bondage that comes from desire-driven action. The verse thus introduces the practical methodology of Karma Yoga that Krishna will elaborate upon in subsequent chapters.",
