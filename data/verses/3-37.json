  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of the mode of passion (rajas), all-devouring and greatly sinful. Know this to be the enemy here in this world.",
  "commentary": "In this pivotal verse, Krishna responds to Arjuna's question about what compels a person to commit sin even unwillingly. He identifies desire (kāma) and its transformation into anger (krodha) as the primary enemies of spiritual progress. Both arise from rajas, the mode of passion, which is characterized by activity, attachment, and restlessness. When desire is thwarted or unfulfilled, it transforms into anger, creating a vicious cycle that binds the soul to material existence.\n\nKrishna describes this desire as 'mahāśana' (all-devouring) because it is insatiable—no amount of gratification can satisfy it; instead, it only grows stronger with indulgence, like fire fed with fuel. He calls it 'mahā-pāpmā' (greatly sinful) because it is the root cause of all sinful activities and the primary obstacle to self-realization. By identifying desire as the 'enemy' (vairiṇam), Krishna emphasizes that the real battle is not on the external battlefield of Kurukshetra, but within one's own mind and heart. This verse is fundamental to understanding the Gita's teaching on the internal obstacles to spiritual progress and sets the stage for the subsequent verses that explain how to overcome this formidable foe through knowledge, discipline, and control of the senses.",
