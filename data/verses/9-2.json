  "sanskrit": "राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम्।\nप्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्यं सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम्॥",
  "transliteration": "rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ pavitram idam uttamam |\npratyakṣāvagamaṁ dharmyaṁ su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam ||",
  "translation": "This is the king of knowledge, the king of secrets, supremely purifying, directly realizable, righteous, very easy to practice, and imperishable.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna extols the supreme nature of the knowledge He is about to impart. He uses five pairs of descriptive terms to emphasize its extraordinary value. By calling it 'rāja-vidyā' (royal knowledge) and 'rāja-guhya' (royal secret), Krishna indicates that this wisdom is sovereign among all forms of knowledge and the most confidential of all secrets. It is 'pavitra' (purifying) and 'uttama' (supreme), capable of cleansing all impurities and standing above all other spiritual practices.\n\nThe verse further describes this knowledge as 'pratyakṣāvagama' - directly perceivable or experientially verifiable, not merely theoretical. Unlike abstract philosophical concepts, this wisdom can be realized through direct experience. It is 'dharmya' (righteous), perfectly aligned with dharma and leading to spiritual merit. Remarkably, Krishna states it is 'su-sukha' (very easy) to practice, dispelling the notion that spiritual realization must be arduously difficult. Finally, it is 'avyaya' (imperishable), meaning its effects are eternal and never diminish. This verse serves as an introduction to the profound devotional knowledge that follows in Chapter 9, preparing Arjuna to receive teachings about bhakti yoga and Krishna's divine nature with proper reverence and understanding.",
