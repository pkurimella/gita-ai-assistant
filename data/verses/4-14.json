  "sanskrit": "न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा।\nइति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "na māṁ karmāṇi limpanti na me karma-phale spṛhā |\niti māṁ yo'bhijānāti karmabhir na sa badhyate ||",
  "translation": "Actions do not taint Me, nor do I have any desire for the fruits of action. One who understands Me thus is not bound by actions.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound truth about His transcendental nature and provides a key to liberation. He declares that despite being the creator and sustainer of the universe, actions do not bind Him because He has no desire for their fruits. This is a crucial teaching that distinguishes divine action from ordinary human action. The Lord acts without attachment or expectation, remaining eternally free and untainted by karma.\n\nThe second half of the verse offers a liberating principle for spiritual aspirants: one who truly understands Krishna's desireless nature and emulates it becomes free from karmic bondage. This understanding is not merely intellectual but transformative—it changes how one performs actions. When a person acts without desire for results, performing duties as offerings to the Divine, they too become free from the binding effects of karma. This verse thus bridges the concept of divine incarnation with practical spiritual instruction, showing that the same principle that keeps God free can liberate human beings.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of Karma Yoga. It establishes that the problem is not action itself, but the desire and attachment associated with it. By understanding and applying this principle—acting without attachment to results—one can remain active in the world while progressing spiritually. This verse also reinforces the importance of right knowledge (jñāna) about the nature of the Divine and how such knowledge directly impacts one's liberation from the cycle of birth and death.",
