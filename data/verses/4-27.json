  "translation": "Others offer all the functions of the senses and the functions of the vital breath (prana) into the fire of the yoga of self-restraint, kindled by knowledge.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes another form of yogic sacrifice practiced by spiritual aspirants. Here, Krishna explains how some practitioners offer all sensory activities and vital functions into the fire of self-control illuminated by wisdom. This represents a higher form of internal sacrifice where the yogi consciously restrains and redirects all sensory impulses and life energies toward spiritual realization rather than worldly pursuits.\n\nThe 'fire of self-restraint' (ātma-saṁyama-yoga-agni) refers to the disciplined practice of controlling one's senses and mind, which is ignited and sustained by discriminative knowledge (jñāna). This is not mere suppression but a conscious offering of all sensory and vital activities to the higher Self. The verse emphasizes that such control is not achieved through force alone but through the illumination of wisdom that reveals the true nature of the Self and the relative insignificance of sensory pleasures.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 4's theme of jñāna-yoga and various forms of sacrifice, this verse illustrates how knowledge transforms ordinary self-discipline into a sacred offering. This practice is particularly relevant to practitioners of Raja Yoga and those following the path of meditation, where control over the senses (pratyahara) and vital energies (pranayama) becomes a means of spiritual purification and self-realization.",
