  "translation": "Whenever there is a decline of righteousness and a rise of unrighteousness, O Bharata (Arjuna), then I manifest Myself.",
  "commentary": "This is one of the most celebrated verses of the Bhagavad Gita, establishing the doctrine of divine incarnation (avatāra). Krishna explains the cosmic principle that governs His periodic descent into the material world. The verse indicates that the Supreme Lord takes birth not out of karmic compulsion like ordinary beings, but out of His own free will to restore dharma when it declines. The repetition 'yadā yadā' (whenever, whenever) emphasizes the recurring nature of these divine manifestations across different ages and epochs.\n\nThe verse identifies two conditions that necessitate divine intervention: glāni (decline, decay) of dharma and abhyutthāna (rising, predominance) of adharma. Dharma here refers to righteousness, cosmic order, moral law, and the principles that sustain society and individual spiritual progress. When these principles are forgotten or violated, and when unrighteousness becomes dominant, threatening the welfare of the world, the Lord manifests in embodied form. The word 'sṛjāmi' (I create/manifest) indicates that the Lord's appearance is a deliberate act of self-projection rather than a forced birth.\n\nThis verse is foundational to understanding the concept of avatāra in Hindu philosophy and has profound implications for the chapter's theme of divine action. It establishes that Krishna is not merely a historical teacher but the eternal Supreme Being who periodically incarnates. This context gives special authority to His teachings on karma yoga and spiritual knowledge. The verse also provides hope and assurance to devotees that divine intervention occurs whenever dharma is threatened, maintaining cosmic balance and protecting the righteous.",
