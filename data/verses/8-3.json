  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: The imperishable, transcendental reality is called Brahman. One's own essential nature is called Adhyatma (the individual self). The creative force that brings forth the existence of beings is called Karma.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins to answer Arjuna's seven questions posed at the end of the previous chapter. He provides fundamental definitions of three key metaphysical concepts. Akṣara Brahman refers to the imperishable, unchanging Supreme Reality that transcends all material manifestations. Svabhāva or Adhyātma refers to the individual soul's inherent nature or the spiritual essence within each being. Karma is defined here not merely as action, but as the creative force (visarga) that causes the manifestation and sustenance of all beings and their various states of existence.\n\nThis verse establishes the foundational terminology for understanding the spiritual path described in this chapter. Krishna systematically addresses the nature of ultimate reality (Brahman), the individual self (Adhyātma), and the principle of action and creation (Karma). The term 'visarga' specifically indicates the emanating or projecting power that brings beings into existence and sustains the cycle of creation. Understanding these three principles is essential for comprehending how one can attain the Supreme at the time of death, which is the central theme of this chapter. These definitions set the stage for the practical instructions on meditation and remembrance that follow in subsequent verses.",
