  "translation": "In a clean place, having established for oneself a firm seat, neither too high nor too low, covered with sacred grass, a deerskin, and cloth, one over the other.",
  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's detailed instruction on the practical aspects of meditation practice. He emphasizes the importance of the external environment and physical setup for successful meditation. The place should be 'shuchi' (clean), indicating both physical cleanliness and spiritual purity. The seat should be stable and firm, suggesting that physical stability aids mental stability. The height specification—neither too high nor too low—ensures proper posture and comfort for extended periods of meditation.\n\nThe traditional arrangement of kusha grass (sacred grass), deerskin, and cloth represents a graduated insulation from the earth, each layer having symbolic and practical significance. Kusha grass is considered purifying in Vedic tradition, deerskin provides insulation and was traditionally associated with ascetic practice, and cloth offers comfort. This careful attention to physical details demonstrates that spiritual practice is not divorced from material considerations but rather integrates them mindfully. The verse teaches that proper preparation of the external environment supports the internal journey of meditation, showing the holistic approach of yoga that honors both body and spirit in the pursuit of self-realization.",
