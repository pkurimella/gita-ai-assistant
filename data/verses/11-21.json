  "sanskrit": "अमी हि त्वां सुरसङ्घा विशन्ति केचिद्भीताः प्राञ्जलयो गृणन्ति |\nस्वस्तीत्युक्त्वा महर्षिसिद्धसङ्घाः स्तुवन्ति त्वां स्तुतिभिः पुष्कलाभिः ||",
  "transliteration": "amī hi tvāṁ sura-saṅghā viśanti kecid bhītāḥ prāñjalayo gṛṇanti |\nsvastīty uktvā maharṣi-siddha-saṅghāḥ stuvanti tvāṁ stutibhiḥ puṣkalābhiḥ ||",
  "translation": "These hosts of celestial beings are entering into You; some, frightened, praise You with joined palms. The assemblies of great sages and perfected beings, saying 'Svasti' (may there be peace and prosperity), hymn Your glories with abundant prayers.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues describing the cosmic vision of Krishna's universal form. He observes that various celestial beings (devas) are entering into the divine form, some with fear and reverence, offering prayers with folded hands. This demonstrates the overwhelming and awe-inspiring nature of the Viśvarūpa, which evokes both devotion and terror even among the gods.\n\nThe verse distinguishes between two groups: those who are frightened and offer prayers with joined palms, and the assemblies of great sages (maharṣis) and perfected beings (siddhas) who chant auspicious benedictions beginning with 'Svasti' and sing elaborate hymns of praise. This indicates that while the universal form inspires fear in some, the wise and spiritually advanced beings respond with devotional hymns and prayers, recognizing the divine majesty before them.\n\nThis verse highlights the universal nature of Krishna's cosmic form, showing that all beings—from celestial gods to perfected sages—acknowledge and worship this supreme manifestation. The response of these exalted beings serves to emphasize the magnitude of what Arjuna is witnessing, reinforcing that this vision transcends ordinary perception and represents the ultimate reality that encompasses all existence.",
