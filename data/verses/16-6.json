  "translation": "There are two types of beings created in this world—the divine and the demoniac. The divine nature has been described at length; now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the demoniac nature.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as a pivotal transition in Chapter 16, where Krishna shifts from describing divine qualities (daivi sampad) to demoniac qualities (asuri sampad). Krishna establishes a fundamental dualistic classification of all created beings in the world, dividing them into two broad categories based on their inherent tendencies and qualities. The divine nature (daiva prakriti) has already been elaborated in the first three verses of this chapter, encompassing twenty-six virtuous qualities such as fearlessness, purity of heart, charity, self-control, and compassion.\n\nKrishna now prepares Arjuna to understand the contrasting demoniac nature, which will be described in the subsequent verses. This classification is not meant to be rigid or permanent; rather, it represents tendencies that individuals cultivate through their choices and actions. The purpose of this teaching is to help spiritual aspirants recognize and cultivate divine qualities while avoiding demoniac traits. By understanding both natures clearly, one can consciously choose the path of spiritual evolution that leads to liberation, rather than the path of bondage that results from demoniac tendencies. This verse emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and discrimination in spiritual practice.",
