  "transliteration": "yaṁ sannyāsam iti prāhur yogaṁ taṁ viddhi pāṇḍava |\nna hy asannyasta-saṅkalpo yogī bhavati kaścana ||",
  "translation": "What they call renunciation (sannyasa), know that to be yoga, O Pandava. No one becomes a yogi without renouncing selfish desires and mental projections.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the fundamental connection between sannyasa (renunciation) and yoga (union with the Divine). He clarifies that true yoga is not merely physical postures or breathing exercises, but requires the renunciation of sankalpa—selfish desires, mental projections, and ego-driven intentions. This is a crucial teaching that bridges the karma yoga of earlier chapters with the dhyana yoga being introduced here.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Pandava' to remind him of his noble lineage and duty. The Lord emphasizes that external renunciation alone is insufficient; what matters is the internal renunciation of desires and attachments that bind the mind. This verse refutes the notion that one can practice yoga while harboring selfish motives or remaining attached to the fruits of actions. The sankalpa that must be renounced includes all forms of ego-centered planning and desire-driven thinking.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 6, which focuses on meditation and self-control. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that meditation (dhyana) requires a mind freed from the turbulence of desires. Without renouncing sankalpa, the mind cannot achieve the steadiness necessary for true yogic practice. This verse thus serves as a bridge between the path of action (karma yoga) and the path of meditation (dhyana yoga), showing they are fundamentally united in their requirement of desirelessness.",
