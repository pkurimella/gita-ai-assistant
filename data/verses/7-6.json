  "translation": "Know that all beings have their origin in these two natures of Mine. I am the source of the entire universe, and into Me it dissolves.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna synthesizes His teaching about His dual nature—the lower material prakṛti (consisting of the eight elements mentioned in verse 4) and the higher spiritual prakṛti (the life force mentioned in verse 5). He declares that all beings in existence arise from the combination of these two aspects of His nature. The material elements provide the physical form, while the higher nature provides the consciousness that animates all life.\n\nKrishna then makes the profound declaration that He is both the origin (prabhava) and dissolution (pralaya) of the entire cosmos. This establishes His position as the ultimate cause—both the efficient and material cause of creation. Unlike dualistic philosophies that separate spirit and matter, Krishna reveals that both emerge from Him and return to Him. This understanding is crucial for the chapter's theme of jñāna-vijñāna (knowledge and realization), as it establishes the non-dual foundation of reality where everything is ultimately grounded in the Divine.\n\nThis verse serves as a pivotal point in Chapter 7, moving from the description of Krishna's dual nature to the assertion of His absolute supremacy as the source and end of all existence. It prepares the ground for understanding how devotion to Krishna encompasses all spiritual practices, since He is the ultimate reality behind all manifestations. The practical implication is that knowing Krishna means knowing the essence of everything, and surrendering to Him means aligning oneself with the fundamental truth of existence.",
