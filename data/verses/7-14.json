  "translation": "This divine illusion of Mine, consisting of the three gunas (qualities of nature), is difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto Me alone cross beyond this illusion.",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces one of the most important concepts in the Bhagavad Gita—Maya, the divine illusion that binds all beings in material existence. Krishna explains that His Maya, composed of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), is extremely difficult to transcend through ordinary means. This Maya is described as 'daivi' (divine) because it originates from the Supreme Lord Himself and serves His purpose of creating the phenomenal world. It is 'duratyaya' (insurmountable) because it deludes even the wise and keeps souls bound in the cycle of birth and death through identification with the body and material nature.\n\nHowever, Krishna provides the solution in the second line: complete surrender (prapadyante) to Him alone is the key to transcending Maya. This surrender is not mere intellectual acknowledgment but total devotion and submission of one's will to the Divine. Those who take refuge in Krishna with single-pointed devotion can cross over this otherwise insurmountable illusion. This verse establishes the supremacy of bhakti (devotion) as the means to liberation, suggesting that while Maya is invincible to human effort alone, divine grace obtained through surrender makes the impossible possible. This teaching connects to the chapter's theme of knowing Krishna in truth, as such knowledge naturally leads to surrender and devotion, which in turn liberates one from Maya's grip.",
