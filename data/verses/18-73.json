  "commentary": "This pivotal verse marks Arjuna's complete transformation and the culmination of Krishna's teachings throughout the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna declares that his moha (delusion) has been destroyed through Krishna's grace (prasāda). The delusion that had paralyzed him at the beginning—his confusion about duty, his attachment to outcomes, and his misidentification with the body—has now been completely removed. He has regained his smṛti (memory or true knowledge), meaning he has remembered his essential nature and his dharmic duty as a warrior.\n\nArjuna's statement 'sthito 'smi gata-sandehaḥ' (I am firm, free from doubt) demonstrates the practical result of spiritual knowledge. He is no longer wavering or confused but stands established in clarity and determination. By addressing Krishna as 'Achyuta' (the infallible one), Arjuna acknowledges the divine authority and unchanging nature of the teacher whose guidance has transformed him. His final declaration 'kariṣye vacanaṁ tava' (I shall do your bidding) shows complete surrender and readiness to act according to divine will, not out of blind obedience but from enlightened understanding.\n\nThis verse represents the ideal outcome of spiritual instruction—the removal of ignorance, the establishment in knowledge, and the translation of that knowledge into righteous action. Arjuna's transformation from a confused, grief-stricken warrior to an enlightened, determined instrument of dharma exemplifies the goal of the Gita's teachings: to live and act in the world with clarity, purpose, and divine awareness.",
