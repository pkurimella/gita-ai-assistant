  "sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nस्थाने हृषीकेश तव प्रकीर्त्या जगत्प्रहृष्यत्यनुरज्यते च।\nरक्षांसि भीतानि दिशो द्रवन्ति सर्वे नमस्यन्ति च सिद्धसङ्घाः॥३६॥",
  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nsthāne hṛṣīkeśa tava prakīrtyā jagat prahṛṣyaty anurajyate ca |\nrakṣāṃsi bhītāni diśo dravanti sarve namasyanti ca siddha-saṅghāḥ || 36 ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: It is fitting, O Hrishikesha (Krishna), that the world rejoices and is attracted by Your glory. The demons flee in fear to all directions, and all the hosts of perfected beings bow down to You.",
  "commentary": "After witnessing the awe-inspiring and terrifying Vishvarupa (Universal Form), Arjuna regains his composure and begins to offer praise to Krishna. In this verse, he acknowledges the appropriateness of the cosmic response to Krishna's divine manifestation. Arjuna observes three distinct reactions: the righteous beings (devas and siddhas) rejoice and bow in devotion, ordinary beings are filled with love and attraction, while the demons (rakshasas) flee in terror. This verse demonstrates Arjuna's understanding that different beings respond to the Divine according to their own nature and disposition.\n\nThe verse highlights an important philosophical principle of the Gita: that the Supreme Reality evokes different responses based on the spiritual evolution and moral character of the observer. Those who are pure and devoted experience joy and devotion, while those who are opposed to dharma experience fear. Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'Hrishikesha' (master of the senses), acknowledging His supreme control over all creation. This verse marks a transition in the chapter from Arjuna's initial terror to his reasoned appreciation of the cosmic order, showing his growing spiritual maturity and understanding of the divine play (lila) unfolding before him.",
