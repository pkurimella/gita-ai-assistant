  "transliteration": "nihatya dhārtarāṣṭrān naḥ kā prītiḥ syāj janārdana |\npāpam evāśrayed asmān hatvaitān ātatāyinaḥ ||",
  "translation": "O Janardana (Krishna), what pleasure can be ours after slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra? Only sin will accrue to us by killing these aggressors.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna directly addresses Krishna and questions what happiness or satisfaction could possibly come from killing his own kinsmen, the sons of Dhritarashtra. Despite acknowledging that the Kauravas are ātatāyins (aggressors or felons), Arjuna argues that killing them would only bring sin upon himself and his brothers. This represents a critical moment in Arjuna's moral crisis, where he is torn between his dharma as a warrior and his emotional attachment to his relatives.\n\nArjuna's use of the term 'janārdana' (one who moves or agitates people) is significant, as it suggests his appeal to Krishna's role as the mover of hearts and minds. He is essentially asking Krishna to understand his emotional turmoil. The verse reveals Arjuna's confusion between different ethical frameworks - the warrior's duty to fight against injustice versus the universal principle of non-violence and the prohibition against killing one's own family members. This confusion sets the stage for Krishna's comprehensive teaching that follows in subsequent chapters, where the concepts of dharma, karma, and detached action will be clarified.",
