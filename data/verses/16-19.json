  "transliteration": "tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān saṁsāreṣu narādhamān |\nkṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu ||",
  "translation": "Those who are envious and cruel, the lowest of mankind, I perpetually cast into the wombs of demons in the cycle of birth and death, into the most degraded species of life.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna describes the destiny of those who possess demoniac qualities. These individuals, characterized by hatred (dviṣataḥ), cruelty (krūrān), and inauspiciousness (aśubhān), are described as the lowest among humans (narādhamān). Their persistent negative tendencies lead them to take birth repeatedly in demoniac wombs (āsurīṣu yoniṣu), perpetuating their degraded state of consciousness. This is not arbitrary punishment but rather the natural consequence of their own actions and mental dispositions, governed by the law of karma.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that those who harbor envy toward God, the devotees, and all beings, and who engage in cruel and harmful activities, create karmic patterns that bind them to lower forms of existence. The word 'ajasram' (perpetually) indicates that this cycle continues until there is a fundamental change in consciousness. This teaching serves as a warning about the consequences of cultivating demoniac qualities and highlights the importance of developing divine virtues as outlined earlier in the chapter.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that the universe operates on the principle of moral causation. Krishna, as the supreme controller, does not arbitrarily punish anyone; rather, He administers the cosmic law that ensures each soul experiences the results of their own choices and actions. This verse underscores the urgency of spiritual practice and the cultivation of divine qualities to break free from the cycle of degradation and move toward liberation.",
