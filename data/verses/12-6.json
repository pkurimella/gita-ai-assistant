  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's description of the devotional path and its fruits, which continues into the next verse. Krishna describes the ideal devotee who practices complete surrender (sarva-karma-sannyasa) by dedicating all actions to the Divine. The phrase 'mat-paraḥ' indicates those who consider Krishna as their supreme goal and refuge, making devotion to Him the central purpose of their existence. The term 'ananyena yogena' emphasizes exclusive, undivided devotion—a yoga practice that does not waver toward any other object or deity.\n\nThis verse establishes the foundation of bhakti yoga as taught in this chapter. The devotee is characterized by three essential qualities: complete surrender of all actions to God, unwavering focus on the Divine as the ultimate goal, and constant meditation with single-pointed concentration. This approach represents the synthesis of karma (action), jnana (knowledge), and bhakti (devotion), where all actions become worship, all thoughts become meditation, and the entire life becomes an offering to the Divine. Krishna presents this path as particularly efficacious for those who find it natural to relate to God through love and devotion rather than through abstract contemplation of the formless Absolute.",
