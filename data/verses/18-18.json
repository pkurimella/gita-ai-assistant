  "transliteration": "jñānaṁ jñeyaṁ parijñātā trividhā karmacodanā |\nkaraṇaṁ karma karteti trividhaḥ karmasaṅgrahaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower form the threefold impulse to action. The instrument, the action, and the agent constitute the threefold basis of action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna analyzes the components of action from both the motivational and operational perspectives. The threefold impulse (karmacodanā) consists of jñāna (knowledge or the means of knowing), jñeya (the object to be known), and parijñātā (the knower or subject). These three elements together create the impetus that drives one toward action. This represents the subjective, cognitive aspect of karma.\n\nThe threefold basis of action (karmasaṅgraha) comprises karaṇa (the instrument or means), karma (the action itself), and kartā (the doer or agent). These constitute the objective, operational components through which action manifests in the world. This verse sets the foundation for the subsequent analysis of the three guṇas (modes of nature) and how they influence each of these components. Understanding this sixfold division is essential for comprehending how actions bind or liberate, depending on the predominance of sattva, rajas, or tamas in each element.\n\nThis analytical framework is crucial in the eighteenth chapter's comprehensive teaching on mokṣa (liberation). By understanding the constituent elements of action, the spiritual aspirant can discern which actions lead to bondage and which lead to freedom. The verse prepares the ground for discriminative wisdom that enables one to perform actions without attachment, a key teaching of the Gita's karma yoga philosophy.",
