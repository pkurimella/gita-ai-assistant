  "transliteration": "brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā karoti yaḥ |\nlipyate na sa pāpena padma-patram ivāmbhasā ||10||",
  "translation": "One who performs actions, offering them to Brahman and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus leaf remains untouched by water.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most beautiful and profound metaphors in the Bhagavad Gita—the lotus leaf analogy. Krishna explains that when a person dedicates all actions to Brahman (the Supreme Reality) and performs them without personal attachment or desire for results, they remain completely untouched by the karmic consequences of those actions, just as water droplets roll off a lotus leaf without wetting it. The lotus grows in muddy water yet remains pristine, symbolizing the spiritual aspirant who lives in the world yet remains unaffected by its binding influences.\n\nThe key to this spiritual immunity lies in two practices: offering all actions to Brahman (brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi) and abandoning attachment (saṅgaṁ tyaktvā). This is the essence of Karma Yoga—performing one's duties with full dedication while maintaining inner detachment. The verse addresses the central concern of Chapter 5: how can one act in the world without accumulating karmic bondage? The answer is through the transformation of consciousness, where the ego-sense of doership is surrendered to the Divine.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Arjuna's dilemma about engaging in battle. Krishna assures him that action performed with the right attitude—as an offering to the Divine rather than for personal gain—does not bind the soul. This principle extends beyond the battlefield to all aspects of life, providing a practical framework for spiritual living in the midst of worldly responsibilities. The verse establishes that renunciation is not about abandoning action but about abandoning the sense of personal ownership and attachment to the fruits of action.",
