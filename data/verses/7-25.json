  "translation": "Veiled by My Yoga-Maya (divine illusory power), I am not revealed to all. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Lord Krishna explains why most people fail to recognize His divine nature. He states that He is not manifest or visible to everyone because He is concealed by His Yoga-Maya—His divine creative power of illusion. This is not an ordinary illusion, but a cosmic power through which the Lord simultaneously reveals and conceals Himself. Only those who have developed spiritual vision through devotion, knowledge, and practice can perceive His true nature beyond the veil of Maya.\n\nThe verse addresses a fundamental question in spiritual philosophy: why don't all beings recognize the Divine if God is omnipresent? Krishna explains that the deluded masses (mūḍha), caught in ignorance and material consciousness, cannot comprehend His transcendental nature as the unborn (aja) and imperishable (avyaya) Supreme Being. They see only the material manifestation and miss the eternal consciousness behind it. This connects to the chapter's theme of knowledge and wisdom, emphasizing that true knowledge involves seeing beyond appearances to recognize the eternal Divine presence. The verse also establishes that God's concealment is purposeful—it allows for free will and the genuine spiritual journey of discovery, rather than forced recognition.",
