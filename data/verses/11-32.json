  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: I am mighty Time, the destroyer of worlds, engaged here in annihilating the worlds. Even without you, all these warriors standing in the opposing armies shall cease to exist.",
  "commentary": "This is one of the most famous verses of the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna reveals His identity as Kāla (Time), the ultimate destroyer. Having shown Arjuna the terrifying cosmic form (Viśvarūpa), Krishna now explains that He is Time itself, which brings about the dissolution of all worlds and beings. The phrase 'loka-kṣaya-kṛt pravṛddhaḥ' emphasizes that Time in its mature, fully manifested form is the inexorable force that consumes everything.\n\nKrishna makes it clear to Arjuna that the warriors arrayed on the battlefield are already destined for destruction by the force of Time. Whether Arjuna fights or not, their death is inevitable—they are already destroyed in the cosmic scheme. This revelation serves to remove Arjuna's sense of personal agency and guilt in the killing of his relatives and teachers. Krishna is essentially telling Arjuna that he would merely be an instrument (nimitta-mātra) in a process that has already been set in motion by divine will.\n\nThis verse addresses the fundamental question of fate versus free will in Hindu philosophy. While it appears deterministic, it actually liberates Arjuna from the paralysis of moral confusion by showing him the larger cosmic perspective. The destruction is not caused by Arjuna's actions but by the inexorable march of Time itself. This teaching encourages Arjuna to fulfill his dharma as a warrior without attachment to the fruits of action, knowing that he is participating in a divine plan that transcends individual will.",
