  "sanskrit": "द्रोणं च भीष्मं च जयद्रथं च कर्णं तथान्यानपि योधवीरान्।\nमया हतांस्त्वं जहि मा व्यथिष्ठा युध्यस्व जेतासि रणे सपत्नान्॥",
  "transliteration": "droṇaṁ ca bhīṣmaṁ ca jayadrathaṁ ca karṇaṁ tathānyān api yodha-vīrān |\nmayā hatāṁs tvaṁ jahi mā vyathiṣṭhā yudhyasva jetāsi raṇe sapatnān ||",
  "translation": "Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna, and other brave warriors have already been slain by Me. Do not be disturbed. Fight! You shall conquer your enemies in battle.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides Arjuna with divine assurance and removes any remaining hesitation about fighting in the war. Having shown Arjuna the cosmic vision where he witnessed the destruction of all warriors, Krishna now explicitly names the great heroes—Drona (the teacher), Bhishma (the grandsire), Jayadratha (who caused Abhimanyu's death), and Karna (Arjuna's rival)—and declares that they are already slain by His divine will. This reveals the profound truth that the outcome of the battle has already been determined at the cosmic level.\n\nKrishna's command 'mā vyathiṣṭhā' (do not be disturbed) addresses Arjuna's emotional turmoil and moral confusion that began in Chapter 1. By revealing that these warriors are already destroyed by divine decree, Krishna establishes that Arjuna is merely an instrument (nimitta-matra) in the cosmic plan. This teaching removes the burden of personal doership and guilt, while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of performing one's dharmic duty. The assurance 'jetāsi' (you shall conquer) is not mere encouragement but a statement of predetermined cosmic reality, urging Arjuna to align his individual will with the divine will and fulfill his role as a warrior without attachment to the fruits of action.",
