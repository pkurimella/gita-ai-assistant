  "sanskrit": "दुःखमित्येव यत्कर्म कायक्लेशभयात्त्यजेत्।\nस कृत्वा राजसं त्यागं नैव त्यागफलं लभेत्॥",
  "transliteration": "duḥkham ity eva yat karma kāya-kleśa-bhayāt tyajet |\nsa kṛtvā rājasaṁ tyāgaṁ naiva tyāga-phalaṁ labhet ||",
  "translation": "One who abandons prescribed duties because they are troublesome or out of fear of bodily discomfort, performs renunciation in the mode of passion. Such a person never attains the true fruit of renunciation.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the second type of defective renunciation—that which is motivated by rajasic (passionate) qualities. This form of tyaga occurs when a person abandons their duties not out of spiritual understanding, but simply because they find the work difficult, uncomfortable, or physically demanding. The key motivation here is avoidance of discomfort rather than genuine spiritual insight or detachment.\n\nThis rajasic renunciation is fundamentally flawed because it is rooted in weakness, fear, and aversion rather than in wisdom and equanimity. When someone gives up their responsibilities merely to escape hardship or physical strain, they are acting from a place of self-centered concern for personal comfort. Such renunciation does not lead to spiritual liberation because it reinforces the ego's attachment to pleasure and aversion to pain, rather than transcending these dualities.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that true renunciation must be based on understanding and detachment, not on laziness or fear. The fruit of genuine tyaga—spiritual freedom and inner peace—cannot be obtained through this rajasic approach. This teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Arjuna's situation, as Krishna is guiding him away from abandoning his duty out of emotional distress and toward performing his dharma with proper understanding and detachment.",
