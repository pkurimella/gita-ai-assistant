  "transliteration": "kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor evam antaraṁ jñāna-cakṣuṣā |\nbhūta-prakṛti-mokṣaṁ ca ye vidur yānti te param ||",
  "translation": "Those who, through the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and the knower of the field, and understand the liberation of beings from material nature, attain the Supreme.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 13 summarizes the essential teaching of the entire chapter. Krishna emphasizes that true liberation comes from discriminative knowledge—the ability to distinguish between kṣetra (the field of matter, including body and mind) and kṣetrajña (the conscious knower, the Self). This discrimination is achieved through jñāna-cakṣuṣā, the 'eye of knowledge' or wisdom, which is cultivated through study, reflection, and meditation on the teachings presented throughout this chapter.\n\nThe verse also introduces the concept of bhūta-prakṛti-mokṣa, liberation from material nature and its modifications. This refers to freedom from identification with the body-mind complex and the material world. When one realizes through direct knowledge that the true Self is distinct from prakṛti (material nature) and its evolutes, one transcends all bondage. Those who attain this wisdom reach 'param'—the Supreme Reality, the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. This verse thus serves as both a summary and an inspiration, pointing seekers toward the highest realization through the cultivation of discriminative wisdom.",
