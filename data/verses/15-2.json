  "sanskrit": "अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृतास्तस्य शाखा गुणप्रवृद्धा विषयप्रवालाः।\nअधश्च मूलान्यनुसन्ततानि कर्मानुबन्धीनि मनुष्यलोके॥",
  "transliteration": "adhaś cordhvaṁ prasṛtās tasya śākhā guṇa-pravṛddhā viṣaya-pravālāḥ |\nadhaś ca mūlāny anusantatāni karmānubandhīni manuṣya-loke ||",
  "translation": "Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the gunas, with sense objects as its sprouts; and below in the human world stretch forth its roots, which bind one to action.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues the description of the cosmic aśvattha tree (the tree of saṁsāra) begun in the previous verse. The branches extending upward and downward represent the various realms of existence—higher celestial worlds and lower material planes. These branches are nourished by the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), which sustain the entire cosmic manifestation. The sense objects (viṣaya) are described as tender shoots or buds, indicating how sensory experiences constantly sprout from this tree of material existence, enticing beings into further entanglement.\n\nThe roots extending downward into the human world are particularly significant. These secondary roots represent vāsanās (latent tendencies) and karmic impressions that bind human beings to the cycle of action and reaction. In the human realm specifically, beings have the unique capacity for karma—deliberate action with moral consequences. These roots of karma create further bondage, causing souls to remain attached to the material world through their actions and their fruits. The verse emphasizes that the human birth is crucial because it is here that karmic bonds are most actively created and can also be transcended through knowledge and devotion.",
