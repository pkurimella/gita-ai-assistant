  "transliteration": "na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ prabhavaṁ na maharṣayaḥ |\naham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Neither the hosts of gods nor the great sages know My origin, for I am the source of all the gods and great sages in every way.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the transcendental nature of His existence by declaring that even the most exalted beings in creation—the devas (celestial gods) and maharshis (great sages)—cannot fully comprehend His origin or prabhava (manifestation). This is because Krishna exists as the ultimate source (ādi) from which all these elevated beings themselves emerge. The verse establishes the supreme position of the Divine as beyond the comprehension of even the highest created intelligences.\n\nThis statement serves a crucial purpose in the context of Chapter 10, where Krishna is about to describe His various manifestations and glories. By first establishing that His true nature is incomprehensible even to gods and sages, Krishna emphasizes the limitation of intellectual understanding alone. The word 'sarvaśaḥ' (in every way) indicates that He is the source not only of their existence but also of their powers, knowledge, and qualities. This verse thus sets the stage for understanding that whatever glories Krishna will describe are merely glimpses of an infinite reality that transcends complete comprehension, yet can be approached through devotion and grace.",
