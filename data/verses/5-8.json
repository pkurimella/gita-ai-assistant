  "transliteration": "naiva kiñcit karomīti yukto manyeta tattvavit |\npaśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighran naśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan ||",
  "translation": "The knower of truth, remaining united with the Self, should think 'I do nothing at all'—while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, and breathing.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a profound teaching on the state of consciousness of one who has realized the true nature of the Self (Atman). Krishna explains that a person established in Self-knowledge (tattvavit) understands that all actions are performed by the senses and the body-mind complex, while the true Self remains ever uninvolved and actionless. Though engaged in various sensory activities—seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, and breathing—such a person maintains the awareness that 'I do nothing at all.'\n\nThis teaching is central to the philosophy of Karma Yoga presented in this chapter. The verse describes the consciousness of a yukta (one who is united with the Self), who has transcended identification with the body and mind. This person witnesses all activities happening through their instrument (body-mind) without claiming doership. This is not a denial of physical activity but a shift in identification from the limited ego-self to the unlimited true Self. The verse lists eight common activities to represent all possible actions, emphasizing that in every moment and every activity, the Self-realized person maintains this awareness of non-doership.\n\nThe practical significance of this teaching is immense for spiritual aspirants. It shows that liberation is not about ceasing all activity but about transforming one's understanding of who is acting. When one realizes that the Atman (Self) is distinct from Prakriti (nature, including body and mind), and that all actions belong to Prakriti alone, one attains freedom even while engaged in worldly activities. This verse thus bridges the apparent contradiction between action and renunciation, showing that true renunciation is internal—a renunciation of the sense of doership rather than the actions themselves.",
