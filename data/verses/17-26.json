  "translation": "The word 'Sat' is used in the sense of reality and goodness; and also, O Partha, the word 'Sat' is applied to auspicious action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His explanation of the sacred syllable 'Sat' (सत्), the third component of the primordial mantra 'Om Tat Sat'. He reveals that 'Sat' has multiple profound meanings: it denotes both absolute reality (sad-bhāva) and goodness or virtue (sādhu-bhāva). This dual significance indicates that true reality and genuine goodness are inseparable in the spiritual realm.\n\nKrishna further explains that the term 'Sat' is appropriately used to describe praiseworthy or auspicious actions (praśaste karmaṇi). This connects the metaphysical concept of absolute reality with practical ethical conduct. Any action performed with dedication, sincerity, and in accordance with dharma can be designated as 'Sat'. This teaching emphasizes that spiritual practice is not merely theoretical but must manifest in righteous action. The verse thus bridges the gap between the transcendent reality represented by 'Sat' and its expression in daily life through virtuous deeds, reinforcing the Gita's consistent message that true spirituality integrates knowledge, devotion, and righteous action.",
