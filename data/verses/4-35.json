  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna promises Arjuna the transformative result of acquiring true spiritual knowledge through approaching a teacher (as described in the previous verse). This knowledge will permanently dispel the delusion that has caused Arjuna's confusion about his duty. The verse reveals a progressive vision of reality: first, one sees all beings as manifestations of the one universal Self (Atman), recognizing the essential unity underlying apparent diversity. This is the realization of the non-dual nature of existence.\n\nThe phrase 'and then in Me' (atho mayi) indicates a further stage of realization where one perceives that even the universal Self is ultimately grounded in the Supreme Reality, Krishna himself. This represents the culmination of spiritual knowledge where the seeker recognizes that all existence, including individual souls and all beings, rests in the Divine. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but transformative, fundamentally changing one's perception of reality and eliminating the root cause of suffering—the sense of separation from the Divine and from other beings. Once this wisdom is attained, the delusion that caused Arjuna to shrink from his duty will never return, as he will see the divine unity pervading all action and all beings.",
