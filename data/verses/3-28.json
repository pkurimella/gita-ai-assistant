  "transliteration": "tattva-vit tu mahā-bāho guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ |\nguṇā guṇeṣu vartanta iti matvā na sajjate ||",
  "translation": "But O mighty-armed Arjuna, one who knows the truth about the divisions of the gunas (qualities) and karmas (actions), understanding that it is the gunas that interact with gunas, does not become attached.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna contrasts the enlightened person (tattva-vit) with the ignorant one described in the previous verse. The knower of truth understands the fundamental principle that all actions in the material world are performed by the three gunas of prakriti (nature)—sattva, rajas, and tamas—and their various combinations. Such a person realizes that the senses (which are manifestations of the gunas) interact with sense objects (also manifestations of the gunas), while the true Self remains the witness, untouched and uninvolved.\n\nThis understanding leads to non-attachment (na sajjate) because the wise person recognizes that the atman (Self) is distinct from the body-mind complex and its activities. While the ignorant person identifies with actions and becomes bound by them, the enlightened person performs actions with the clear knowledge that \"I am not the doer; the gunas act upon the gunas.\" This verse is central to the Gita's teaching on karma yoga, establishing the philosophical foundation for action without attachment. It shows how right knowledge transforms one's relationship with action, allowing one to remain free even while engaged in the world.",
