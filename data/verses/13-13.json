  "translation": "I shall now describe that which is to be known, knowing which one attains immortality. It is the beginningless Supreme Brahman, which is said to be neither existent nor non-existent.",
  "commentary": "This pivotal verse marks a transition in Chapter 13 as Krishna begins to describe the ultimate object of knowledge—Brahman itself. After describing the field (kṣetra) and the qualities necessary for knowledge, Krishna now turns to what must be known (jñeya). He promises that knowing this Supreme Reality leads to amṛta (immortality or liberation), emphasizing the practical soteriological purpose of this knowledge.\n\nThe description of Brahman as 'anādi' (beginningless) and 'param' (supreme) establishes its transcendent nature. The most philosophically significant phrase is that Brahman is neither 'sat' (existent) nor 'asat' (non-existent). This is not a contradiction but points to Brahman's transcendence of all conceptual categories. It exists beyond the dualities of being and non-being as ordinarily understood—it is not non-existent like a fantasy, nor is it existent like material objects. This formulation anticipates the via negativa (neti neti) approach of Vedantic philosophy, indicating that ultimate reality transcends all limited definitions and can only be approached through direct realization rather than mere intellectual categorization.",
