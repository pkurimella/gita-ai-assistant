  "transliteration": "idaṁ jñānam upāśritya mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ |\nsarge 'pi nopajāyante pralaye na vyathanti ca ||",
  "translation": "Taking refuge in this knowledge, having attained to My nature, they are not born again at the time of creation, nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the supreme benefit of the transcendental knowledge (jñāna) that He is about to impart. Those who take complete refuge in this wisdom attain 'sādharmya' - similarity or identity with the Divine nature. This does not mean they become God, but rather they attain the same spiritual nature, free from material conditioning and the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two key liberations: freedom from rebirth during creation (sarga) and freedom from fear during cosmic dissolution (pralaya). Even when the entire material universe undergoes periodic creation and destruction, those established in this supreme knowledge remain unaffected, having transcended the realm of material nature and its transformations. This state represents complete liberation (moksha) where the soul is no longer subject to the laws of karma and the cycle of samsara.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for the detailed teaching about the three gunas that follows, showing that the ultimate goal is to transcend these modes of material nature entirely. It serves as a powerful motivation for Arjuna and all seekers to pay careful attention to the knowledge Krishna is about to reveal, as it leads to the highest spiritual attainment - unity with the Divine nature and permanent freedom from material existence.",
