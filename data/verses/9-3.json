  "translation": "O scorcher of foes, those who lack faith in this dharma (teaching) fail to reach Me and return to the path of death and rebirth in the material world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna warns about the consequences of lacking faith (śraddhā) in the supreme knowledge He is imparting. The term 'dharmasyāsya' refers to the spiritual path and teachings being revealed in this chapter. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'parantapa' (scorcher of foes), reminding him of his warrior nature while discussing the most subtle spiritual truths. The verse emphasizes that mere intellectual understanding is insufficient; faith is the essential foundation for spiritual progress.\n\nThe phrase 'mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani' (the path of death and rebirth) describes the cyclical nature of material existence that binds those who reject or doubt this knowledge. Without faith, individuals cannot transcend the limitations of material consciousness and remain trapped in the cycle of birth and death. This verse establishes faith as the prerequisite for receiving the royal knowledge that follows, connecting to the previous verse's description of this knowledge as 'pratyakṣāvagamam' (directly perceivable) for those who have the proper receptivity. Krishna thus sets the stage for revealing deeper mysteries by first addressing the fundamental requirement of śraddhā, which enables the spiritual transformation that this chapter promises.",
