  "translation": "Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier. You are the Eternal Divine Person, the Primeval God, the Unborn, and the All-Pervading.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks Arjuna's profound acknowledgment of Krishna's divine nature after hearing the discourse on divine manifestations. Arjuna addresses Krishna with a series of supreme epithets, recognizing Him as the ultimate reality (param brahma), the highest refuge (param dhāma), and the supreme purifier (pavitram paramam). These declarations demonstrate Arjuna's complete understanding and acceptance of Krishna's transcendental position.\n\nArjuna's description continues by calling Krishna the eternal divine person (puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam), emphasizing both His personal aspect and His eternal nature. The terms ādi-deva (primeval God), aja (unborn), and vibhu (all-pervading) establish Krishna's position as both the source of all existence and beyond the limitations of birth and death. This verse serves as a prelude to Arjuna's request for direct vision of the universal form, showing his readiness to receive higher knowledge. The acknowledgment is significant because it comes not merely from blind faith but from reasoned understanding based on Krishna's teachings and Arjuna's own spiritual realization.",
