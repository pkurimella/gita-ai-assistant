  "sanskrit": "योत्स्यमानानवेक्षेऽहं य एतेऽत्र समागताः।\nधार्तराष्ट्रस्य दुर्बुद्धेर्युद्धे प्रियचिकीर्षवः॥",
  "transliteration": "yotsyamānān avekṣe'haṁ ya ete'tra samāgatāḥ |\ndhārtarāṣṭrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyacikīrṣavaḥ ||",
  "translation": "I wish to see those who have assembled here, eager to fight, desiring to please in battle the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his desire to survey the warriors assembled on the battlefield. He specifically wants to observe those who have gathered to fight on behalf of Duryodhana, whom he characterizes as 'durbuddhi' (evil-minded or of perverted intellect). Arjuna's request appears tactical on the surface—a warrior wanting to assess his opponents before battle—but it also reveals his psychological state and sets the stage for the moral crisis that will soon overwhelm him.\n\nArjuna's reference to Duryodhana as the 'evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra' is significant. It shows that Arjuna is fully aware of the moral dimensions of this war. He recognizes that those assembled are fighting not for dharma, but to gratify Duryodhana's ambitions born of his flawed understanding and character. This verse is crucial because it demonstrates that Arjuna's subsequent breakdown is not due to ignorance of right and wrong, but rather from a deeper conflict between his duty as a warrior and his emotional attachments to those he must fight. The verse also subtly criticizes those warriors who have chosen to support adharma (unrighteousness) merely out of loyalty or self-interest, foreshadowing the ethical complexities that the Gita will address.",
