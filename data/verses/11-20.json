  "sanskrit": "द्यावापृथिव्योरिदमन्तरं हि व्याप्तं त्वयैकेन दिशश्च सर्वाः।\nदृष्ट्वाद्भुतं रूपमुग्रं तवेदं लोकत्रयं प्रव्यथितं महात्मन्।।",
  "transliteration": "dyāvā-pṛthivyor idam antaraṁ hi vyāptaṁ tvayaikena diśaś ca sarvāḥ |\ndṛṣṭvādbhutaṁ rūpam ugraṁ tavedaṁ loka-trayaṁ pravyathitaṁ mahātman ||",
  "translation": "The space between heaven and earth is pervaded by You alone, and all the directions as well. O Great Soul, seeing this wondrous and terrible form of Yours, the three worlds tremble with fear.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna describes the cosmic magnitude of Krishna's Universal Form (Vishvarupa). He observes that Krishna's form fills the entire space between heaven and earth, extending in all directions without limit. This vision transcends ordinary spatial dimensions, revealing the all-pervading nature of the Divine that encompasses the entire manifest universe.\n\nArjuna uses two significant adjectives to describe this form: 'adbhuta' (wondrous, marvelous) and 'ugra' (terrible, fierce). This dual nature reflects the complete reality of the Divine—both beautiful and terrifying, creative and destructive. The vision is so overwhelming that not just Arjuna, but all three worlds (triloka: heaven, earth, and the netherworld) are trembling. This universal trembling represents the natural response of limited beings when confronted with the unlimited, infinite reality of the Supreme.\n\nBy addressing Krishna as 'Mahatman' (Great Soul), Arjuna acknowledges the supreme spiritual magnitude of the Divine. This verse captures the essence of the Vishvarupa darshana—a revelation that is simultaneously awe-inspiring and fear-inducing, demonstrating that the ultimate reality encompasses all dualities and transcends human comprehension. The trembling of the three worlds symbolizes the dissolution of limited perspectives in the face of infinite truth.",
