  "sanskrit": "यदा ते मोहकलिलं बुद्धिर्व्यतितरिष्यति ।\nतदा गन्तासि निर्वेदं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च ॥",
  "transliteration": "yadā te moha-kalilaṁ buddhir vyatitariṣyati |\ntadā gantāsi nirvedaṁ śrotavyasya śrutasya ca ||",
  "translation": "When your intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then you shall attain indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the state of consciousness that arises when one transcends delusion through discriminative wisdom. The 'mire of delusion' (moha-kalilam) refers to the confusion and ignorance that clouds one's understanding of reality, causing attachment to the material world and its dualities. When the intellect (buddhi) crosses beyond this delusion, one attains a state of spiritual clarity and detachment.\n\nThe 'indifference' (nirveda) mentioned here is not apathy or disinterest, but rather a transcendental state where one is no longer swayed by scriptural injunctions or philosophical debates. This represents a stage beyond mere intellectual knowledge, where direct realization supersedes bookish learning. The phrase 'what has been heard and what is yet to be heard' refers to all scriptural knowledge—both that which one has already studied and that which remains to be studied. When one attains self-realization, the need for external validation through scriptures diminishes, as one experiences the truth directly.\n\nThis verse is significant in the progression of Krishna's teaching in Chapter 2, as it describes the intermediate stage between theoretical knowledge and complete self-realization. It prepares Arjuna for the next verse, which will describe the state of steady wisdom (sthita-prajña). The verse emphasizes that true spiritual progress involves moving from intellectual understanding to direct experiential knowledge, transcending even the scriptures themselves.",
