  "transliteration": "vaktum arhasy aśeṣeṇa divyā hy ātma-vibhūtayaḥ |\nyābhir vibhūtibhir lokān imāṁs tvaṁ vyāpya tiṣṭhasi ||",
  "translation": "You alone are able to describe in full Your divine manifestations, by which manifestations You pervade and remain present in all these worlds.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna humbly requests Krishna to elaborate comprehensively on His divine manifestations (vibhūtis). Arjuna acknowledges that only Krishna Himself can fully describe His own glories, as no one else possesses complete knowledge of the infinite manifestations of the Divine. The word 'aśeṣeṇa' (completely, without remainder) indicates Arjuna's desire for an exhaustive description, though he recognizes the impossibility of fully comprehending the infinite.\n\nArjuna specifically asks about the vibhūtis through which Krishna pervades (vyāpya) and remains established (tiṣṭhasi) in all the worlds. This question reveals Arjuna's understanding that God is both immanent and transcendent—He pervades all creation while simultaneously remaining beyond it. The use of 'divyā' (divine) emphasizes that these manifestations are supernatural and beyond ordinary perception, requiring divine revelation for their understanding.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for Krishna's detailed exposition of His prominent manifestations in the following verses. Arjuna's request demonstrates the devotee's proper attitude of humility and eagerness to know the Divine. It also highlights an important spiritual principle: true knowledge of God comes through divine grace and self-revelation, not merely through intellectual speculation. The verse emphasizes that while God is one, He manifests in countless forms throughout creation, and understanding these manifestations helps the devotee recognize the Divine presence everywhere.",
