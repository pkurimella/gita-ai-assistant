  "sanskrit": "एवं ज्ञात्वा कृतं कर्म पूर्वैरपि मुमुक्षुभिः।\nकुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वं पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम्।।",
  "transliteration": "evaṁ jñātvā kṛtaṁ karma pūrvair api mumukṣubhiḥ |\nkuru karmaiva tasmāt tvaṁ pūrvaiḥ pūrvataraṁ kṛtam ||",
  "translation": "Knowing thus, action was performed even by the ancient seekers of liberation. Therefore, you too perform action, as did the ancients in former times.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides historical validation for the path of action performed with proper knowledge. He assures Arjuna that the great seekers of liberation (mumukṣus) in ancient times also performed their duties while possessing the wisdom of action and inaction. This establishes a sacred precedent and removes any doubt about whether enlightened beings should engage in action. The verse serves as a bridge between the philosophical exposition of karma yoga and its practical application.\n\nKrishna's reference to the 'ancients' (pūrvaiḥ) includes illustrious ancestors like King Janaka and other royal sages who attained liberation while fulfilling their worldly responsibilities. This is particularly relevant to Arjuna's situation as a warrior-prince facing his dharmic duty. The Lord is essentially saying that the path of performing one's duty with knowledge is not a compromise or inferior path, but the very same path trodden by the greatest spiritual aspirants. The emphasis on 'knowing thus' (evaṁ jñātvā) refers to understanding the true nature of action, the Self as non-doer, and the principle of offering all actions to the Divine as explained in previous verses. This knowledge transforms ordinary action into a means of liberation, making it possible to be active in the world while remaining spiritually free.",
