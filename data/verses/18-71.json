  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna extends the benefits of the Gita's teachings even to those who may not be able to fully practice or comprehend its deepest philosophical truths. He emphasizes that even the act of listening (śravaṇa) to this sacred dialogue with faith (śraddhā) and without malice or envy (anasūya) brings tremendous spiritual merit. This highlights the accessibility and universal applicability of the Gita's message—one need not be a renunciant or advanced yogi to benefit from its wisdom.\n\nThe verse establishes a hierarchy of spiritual attainment: while earlier verses promised the highest liberation to those who study and teach the Gita, here Krishna assures that even faithful listeners will be freed from bondage and attain the meritorious worlds (puṇya-loka) earned by those who perform virtuous actions. This represents an intermediate stage of spiritual progress, where one may not achieve immediate moksha but certainly transcends the cycle of suffering and attains heavenly realms. The emphasis on being 'anasūya' (without envy or fault-finding) is crucial, as it indicates the receptive and humble attitude necessary for spiritual growth.\n\nThis teaching reflects the Gita's inclusive approach to spirituality, recognizing that people are at different stages of their spiritual journey. By offering benefits even to sincere listeners, Krishna ensures that the Gita remains accessible to all seekers, regardless of their current level of understanding or practice. The verse also underscores the power of śravaṇa (listening) as a valid spiritual practice in itself, a concept deeply rooted in Vedantic tradition.",
