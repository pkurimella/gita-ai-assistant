  "sanskrit": "स घोषो धार्तराष्ट्राणां हृदयानि व्यदारयत् ।\nनभश्च पृथिवीं चैव तुमुलो व्यनुनादयन् ॥१९॥",
  "transliteration": "sa ghoṣo dhārtarāṣṭrāṇāṁ hṛdayāni vyadārayat |\nnabhaś ca pṛthivīṁ caiva tumulo vyanunādayan ||19||",
  "translation": "That tumultuous uproar, resounding through earth and sky, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's sons.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the psychological impact of the tremendous sound produced by the Pandava forces blowing their conches. The word 'vyadārayat' (rent or tore apart) indicates that the sound had a devastating effect on the morale of the Kauravas. The verse emphasizes that this was not merely a physical sound, but one that penetrated deep into the hearts (hṛdayāni) of Dhritarashtra's sons, filling them with fear and foreboding.\n\nSanjaya's description serves a dual purpose in his narration to the blind king Dhritarashtra. On one level, it provides a vivid account of the battlefield atmosphere. On a deeper level, it subtly suggests the inevitable outcome of the war—the sound that fills heaven and earth and pierces the hearts of the Kauravas foreshadows their defeat. The cosmic scale of the description (nabhaś ca pṛthivīṁ caiva—both sky and earth) elevates this moment beyond a mere military encounter to a dharmic confrontation of universal significance.\n\nThis verse marks a transition in the narrative. Having described the confidence and preparation of both armies, Sanjaya now reveals the first crack in the Kaurava confidence. The psychological warfare has begun even before physical combat, and the righteous cause of the Pandavas, symbolized by their divine conch sounds, has already begun to affect their opponents. This sets the stage for the moral and spiritual crisis that Arjuna will soon experience.",
