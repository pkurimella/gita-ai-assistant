  "transliteration": "adhiṣṭhānaṁ tathā kartā karaṇaṁ ca pṛthagvidham|\nvividhāś ca pṛthakceṣṭā daivaṁ caivātra pañcamam||",
  "translation": "The body (seat of action), the doer, the various senses, the many different kinds of efforts, and the presiding deity as the fifth—these are the five factors of action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna enumerates the five factors that are essential for the accomplishment of any action according to Sankhya philosophy. These are: (1) adhiṣṭhāna - the physical body or the locus where action takes place, (2) kartā - the agent or doer who performs the action, (3) karaṇa - the various instruments or sense organs used in performing the action, (4) ceṣṭā - the different types of efforts or movements required, and (5) daiva - the presiding deity or divine will, representing the unseen forces and past karmas that influence the outcome.\n\nThis analysis is crucial in the context of Chapter 18 because it helps Arjuna understand that action is not accomplished by the individual ego alone. By recognizing these five factors, one develops a more comprehensive and humble understanding of action. The inclusion of 'daiva' as the fifth factor is particularly significant as it acknowledges that despite our best efforts, there are forces beyond our control that influence results. This understanding helps cultivate detachment from the fruits of action, which is central to karma yoga. Krishna presents this framework to help Arjuna transcend the limited notion of individual doership and recognize the complex interplay of factors in any action, thereby reducing ego-identification and attachment to outcomes.",
