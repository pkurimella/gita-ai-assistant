  "transliteration": "api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk |\nsādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ samyag vyavasito hi saḥ ||",
  "translation": "Even if the most sinful person worships Me with undivided devotion, he should be regarded as righteous, for he has rightly resolved.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most compassionate and liberating teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna declares that even a person of extremely sinful conduct (sudurācāra), if they worship Him with exclusive devotion (ananya-bhāk), should be considered a saint (sādhu). The key qualifier is 'ananya-bhāk'—one whose devotion is undivided and exclusive. This indicates that the person has made a firm resolution (samyag vyavasita) to transform their life through devotion to the Divine.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the transformative power of bhakti (devotion) over past karma. Krishna is not condoning sinful behavior, but rather acknowledging that sincere devotion marks a turning point in one's spiritual journey. The phrase 'samyag vyavasitaḥ' indicates that such a devotee has made a proper and complete determination to change. This resolution itself is worthy of respect because it demonstrates the beginning of genuine transformation. The verse illustrates that devotion to God has the power to purify even the most tainted heart.\n\nThis teaching fits perfectly within Chapter 9's theme of royal knowledge and supreme secret. It reveals the democratic and accessible nature of bhakti yoga—that divine grace is available to all, regardless of past actions, provided the devotion is sincere and exclusive. This verse has provided hope and solace to countless seekers throughout history, demonstrating that no one is beyond redemption when they turn wholeheartedly toward the Divine.",
