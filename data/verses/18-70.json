  "transliteration": "adhyeṣyate ca ya imaṁ dharmyaṁ saṁvādam āvayoḥ |\njñāna-yajñena tenāham iṣṭaḥ syām iti me matiḥ ||",
  "translation": "And whoever will study this sacred dialogue of ours, by that person I shall be worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge—this is My conviction.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna declares the spiritual merit of studying the Bhagavad Gita itself. He elevates the study of this sacred dialogue to the status of jñāna-yajña (sacrifice of knowledge), which is considered one of the highest forms of worship. This indicates that sincere study and contemplation of the Gita's teachings is not merely an intellectual exercise, but a form of devotional offering to the Divine.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that those who study this 'dharmya saṁvāda' (righteous dialogue) are performing an act of worship. This is significant because it democratizes spiritual practice—one need not perform elaborate rituals or possess material wealth to worship the Lord. The sacrifice of knowledge requires only sincere effort, intellectual honesty, and a genuine desire to understand the truth. Krishna's use of 'iṣṭaḥ syām' (I shall be worshipped) indicates His pleasure in those who earnestly engage with these teachings.\n\nThis verse also serves as Krishna's endorsement of the Gita's preservation and dissemination. By declaring that study of this dialogue constitutes worship, He ensures that these teachings will be valued, preserved, and transmitted through generations. It establishes the Gita not just as a philosophical text, but as a sacred scripture whose study itself is a spiritual practice leading to liberation.",
