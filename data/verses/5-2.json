  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: Both renunciation of action (sannyasa) and the yoga of action (karma yoga) lead to the highest good. But of the two, karma yoga is superior to the renunciation of action.",
  "commentary": "In response to Arjuna's question in the previous verse about which path is better—renunciation or action—Krishna provides a nuanced answer. He acknowledges that both paths can lead to liberation (niḥśreyasa), validating both approaches to spiritual life. However, he clearly states that karma yoga is superior to sannyasa for most practitioners. This is a significant statement that sets the tone for the entire chapter.\n\nKrishna's preference for karma yoga over sannyasa is based on practical wisdom. True renunciation (sannyasa) requires complete detachment and inner maturity that few possess. Karma yoga, on the other hand, is more accessible and sustainable for most people, as it involves performing one's duties without attachment to results. This path purifies the mind and gradually leads to the same goal as sannyasa. The superiority of karma yoga lies in its practicality and its ability to transform ordinary life into a spiritual practice, making it suitable for people at various stages of spiritual evolution.\n\nThis verse establishes a key theme of the Bhagavad Gita: the integration of action and spirituality. Krishna is not dismissing renunciation but rather clarifying that external renunciation without internal detachment is incomplete. The true renunciation happens in the mind, and this can be achieved more effectively through karma yoga, where one remains engaged in the world while maintaining inner freedom. This teaching is particularly relevant for Arjuna, a warrior who cannot simply abandon his duties.",
