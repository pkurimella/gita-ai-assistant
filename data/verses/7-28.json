  "transliteration": "yeṣāṁ tv antagataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām|\nte dvandva-moha-nirmuktā bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ||",
  "translation": "But those persons of virtuous deeds, whose sins have come to an end, freed from the delusion of dualities, worship Me with firm resolve.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a turning point in Chapter 7, contrasting with the previous verses that described those bound by maya and delusion. Krishna explains that only those whose karmic impurities (papa) have been exhausted through virtuous actions (punya-karmana) can truly worship Him with single-pointed devotion. The phrase 'antagatam papam' indicates that their sins have reached their end, suggesting a purified state of consciousness achieved through sustained righteous living.\n\nThe key obstacle mentioned here is 'dvandva-moha' - the delusion arising from dualities such as pleasure-pain, honor-dishonor, success-failure. Those who transcend this dualistic perception can see the Divine reality beyond the pairs of opposites that bind ordinary consciousness. Such devotees worship Krishna with 'dridha-vrata' - firm determination and unwavering commitment. This verse establishes that spiritual realization requires both ethical purification and transcendence of dualistic thinking.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 7's theme of knowledge and wisdom, this verse explains the prerequisites for true devotion. It suggests a progressive path: virtuous actions purify the heart, this purification enables one to transcend dualistic delusion, and freedom from delusion allows for steadfast devotion to the Supreme. This sets the stage for the following verses which will describe the characteristics of such devoted seekers.",
