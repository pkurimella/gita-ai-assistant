  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: While speaking words of wisdom, you grieve for those who are not worthy of grief. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Krishna's profound teachings to Arjuna. Krishna gently points out the contradiction in Arjuna's position: though he speaks with apparent philosophical sophistication about dharma and the consequences of war, he is grieving for those who do not deserve grief—warriors who are fulfilling their duty. Krishna identifies the root problem as Arjuna's confusion between the temporary body and the eternal soul.\n\nThe term 'paṇḍitāḥ' (the wise) refers to those who have realized the distinction between the body and the Self. Such enlightened beings understand that the soul is eternal and indestructible, while the body is temporary. Therefore, they do not lament either for those whose bodies have perished (gatāsūn) or for those still living (agatāsūn), because they see beyond the physical form to the immortal essence within all beings. This verse sets the stage for Krishna's teaching on the eternal nature of the soul that follows in subsequent verses, which forms the philosophical foundation for resolving Arjuna's crisis of conscience.",
