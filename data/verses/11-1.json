  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nmad-anugrahāya paramaṁ guhyam adhyātma-saṁjñitam |\nyat tvayoktaṁ vacas tena moho 'yaṁ vigato mama ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: Out of compassion for me, You have spoken the supreme secret concerning the Self (adhyātma). By these words of Yours, my delusion has been dispelled.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks Arjuna's acknowledgment of Krishna's profound teachings from the previous chapter, particularly the discourse on the divine manifestations (vibhūti) and the supreme nature of the Divine. Arjuna expresses his gratitude, recognizing that Krishna has revealed the most confidential spiritual knowledge out of grace and compassion. The term 'adhyātma' refers to the knowledge of the Supreme Self, which Krishna elaborated upon in Chapter 10, explaining His divine glories and manifestations throughout creation.\n\nArjuna's statement that his delusion (moha) has been dispelled indicates a significant transformation in his understanding. The confusion that plagued him at the beginning of the Gita—regarding his duty, the nature of action, and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supreme—has now been cleared through Krishna's systematic instruction. This verse serves as a bridge, showing Arjuna's readiness for the extraordinary vision he is about to request and receive in this chapter.\n\nThe verse also highlights the importance of divine grace (anugraha) in spiritual understanding. Despite all the intellectual explanations, Arjuna recognizes that it is Krishna's compassion that has enabled him to comprehend these profound truths. This sets the stage for the most dramatic revelation in the Gita—the cosmic form (Viśvarūpa) of the Lord—which will be unveiled in the subsequent verses, demonstrating visually what has been explained philosophically.",
