  "commentary": "This opening verse of Chapter 14 marks Krishna's introduction to the profound teaching on the three gunas (qualities of nature): sattva, rajas, and tamas. Krishna emphasizes the supreme importance of this knowledge by calling it 'the best of all knowledge' (jñānām uttamam). This declaration indicates that understanding the gunas is essential for spiritual liberation, as it reveals how prakṛti (material nature) operates and binds the soul.\n\nKrishna validates this teaching by pointing to its results - all the great sages (munayaḥ sarve) who knew this wisdom attained parā siddhi (supreme perfection or liberation). This verse serves as a bridge from the previous chapter's discussion of the kṣetra-kṣetrajña (field and knower of the field) to a more detailed analysis of how the three gunas condition all embodied existence. The knowledge of the gunas is practical wisdom that enables the spiritual aspirant to transcend material conditioning and realize their true nature beyond the influence of prakṛti.",
