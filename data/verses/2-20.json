  "sanskrit": "न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः। अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे॥",
  "transliteration": "na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ | ajo nityaḥ śāśvato'yaṁ purāṇo na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre ||",
  "translation": "The soul is never born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most profound teachings of the Bhagavad Gita regarding the eternal nature of the soul (ātman). Krishna explains to Arjuna that the true self is completely distinct from the physical body and transcends all temporal changes. The soul never undergoes birth or death, which are characteristics only of the material body. Using six distinct adjectives—unborn (aja), eternal (nitya), everlasting (śāśvata), primordial (purāṇa), and two phrases describing its imperishable nature—Krishna emphasizes the immortal essence of consciousness.\n\nThis teaching directly addresses Arjuna's grief over killing his relatives in battle. If the soul is eternal and indestructible, then death is merely a transition of the body, not an annihilation of the person's true essence. The verse establishes the fundamental Vedantic principle that reality consists of two distinct categories: the eternal, unchanging consciousness (puruṣa) and the temporary, ever-changing matter (prakṛti). Understanding this distinction is essential for spiritual wisdom and liberation from sorrow.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse extends beyond the immediate context of the battlefield. It forms the foundation for understanding karma, reincarnation, and the ultimate goal of self-realization in Hindu philosophy. By recognizing the eternal nature of the self, one can transcend attachment to temporary bodily identifications and the fear of death, achieving equanimity in all circumstances.",
