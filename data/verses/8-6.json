  "transliteration": "yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram |\ntaṁ tam evaiti kaunteya sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Whatever state of being one remembers when leaving the body at death, to that very state one goes, O son of Kunti, being always absorbed in that thought.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes a fundamental principle of consciousness and rebirth in Vedantic philosophy. Krishna explains that the nature of one's thoughts at the moment of death determines one's next state of existence. The consciousness that predominates throughout life, and especially at death, shapes one's destination in the afterlife. This is not arbitrary but follows the law of karma and mental conditioning—whatever absorbs our mind throughout life will naturally surface at death.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of constant practice (abhyāsa) and mental discipline throughout one's lifetime. Since the final moment of death reflects the accumulated tendencies and thoughts of an entire lifetime, one cannot suddenly think of the Divine at death without prior practice. The phrase 'sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ' (always absorbed in that thought) indicates that the final thought is merely the culmination of habitual thinking patterns. This underscores why Krishna repeatedly emphasizes remembering Him constantly, not just at death.\n\nThis teaching has profound practical implications for spiritual practice. It validates the importance of regular meditation, devotion, and mindfulness in daily life. The verse serves as a bridge to the following verses where Krishna will explain how to cultivate constant remembrance of the Divine. It also provides the philosophical foundation for understanding why different beings attain different destinations after death—each goes according to their predominant consciousness and mental absorption.",
