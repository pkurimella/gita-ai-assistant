  "transliteration": "ihaiva tair jitaḥ sargo yeṣāṁ sāmye sthitaṁ manaḥ |\nnirdoṣaṁ hi samaṁ brahma tasmād brahmaṇi te sthitāḥ ||5.19||",
  "translation": "Even here in this world, birth and death are conquered by those whose minds are established in equanimity. Since Brahman is flawless and equal in all, they are therefore established in Brahman.",
  "commentary": "This verse reveals the supreme achievement of those who have attained equanimity of mind. Krishna declares that such individuals transcend the cycle of birth and death (samsara) even while living in the physical body. The key to this liberation is maintaining the mind in a state of perfect balance (samya), seeing the same divine essence in all beings and circumstances. This equanimity is not mere indifference but a profound spiritual realization rooted in the understanding of Brahman's nature.\n\nThe verse establishes a direct correlation between equanimity and God-realization. Brahman, the ultimate reality, is described as 'nirdosha' (flawless) and 'sama' (equal, impartial). Since Brahman pervades all existence equally without distinction or defect, those who cultivate equal vision naturally align themselves with this divine nature. By maintaining mental equilibrium in pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor, success and failure, the spiritual aspirant mirrors the unchanging nature of Brahman itself.\n\nThis teaching is central to the chapter's theme of Karma Yoga and renunciation. It demonstrates that true renunciation is not abandoning action but transcending the dualities that bind consciousness. Those established in equanimity have conquered the world of duality (sarga) and achieved jivanmukti (liberation while living). They remain physically present in the world but are spiritually established in Brahman, having transcended identification with the body-mind complex and the karmic cycle that perpetuates rebirth.",
