  "sanskrit": "यज्ञे तपसि दाने च स्थितिः सदिति चोच्यते।\nकर्म चैव तदर्थीयं सदित्येवाभिधीयते॥",
  "transliteration": "yajñe tapasi dāne ca sthitiḥ sad iti cocyate |\nkarma caiva tadarthīyaṃ sad ity evābhidhīyate ||",
  "translation": "Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and charity is also called SAT. And any action for such purposes is likewise called SAT.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna expands on the practical applications of the sacred syllable SAT, which represents truth, reality, and goodness. He explains that when one remains steadfast (sthiti) in performing sacrifice (yajña), austerity (tapas), and charity (dāna), such steadfastness itself is designated as SAT. This indicates that these three fundamental spiritual practices, when performed with proper understanding and dedication, embody the principle of ultimate reality.\n\nFurthermore, Krishna emphasizes that any action (karma) performed for the sake of these three practices—sacrifice, austerity, and charity—is also termed SAT. This means that not only the main practices themselves, but also all preparatory and supporting actions undertaken with the intention of facilitating these spiritual disciplines are considered sacred and aligned with truth. This verse thus establishes a comprehensive framework where both the primary spiritual practices and their supporting activities are elevated to the status of SAT, provided they are performed with the right intention and understanding. This teaching connects directly to the earlier verses of the chapter discussing the three types of faith and the importance of performing actions in accordance with scriptural injunctions and with devotion to the Supreme.",
