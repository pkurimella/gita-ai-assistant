  "translation": "Better is one's own duty, though imperfectly performed, than the duty of another well performed. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with danger.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most fundamental principles of the Bhagavad Gita regarding dharma and individual duty. Krishna emphasizes that each person has their own unique dharma (svadharma) based on their nature, capacities, and position in life. Even if one's own dharma appears inferior or is imperfectly executed, it is superior to adopting another's dharma, no matter how well that foreign duty might be performed. This teaching directly addresses Arjuna's crisis, as he contemplates abandoning his kshatriya dharma of fighting for what he perceives as a more peaceful path.\n\nThe verse's stark declaration that death in one's own dharma is preferable to another's duty underscores the gravity of this principle. Krishna warns that paradharma (another's duty) is 'bhayavaha'—full of fear and danger. This danger is not merely external but spiritual and psychological. When one acts against their inherent nature and prescribed duty, they create inner conflict, lose authenticity, and fail to fulfill their evolutionary purpose. The verse teaches that spiritual progress comes not from imitating others' paths, but from perfecting one's own unique role in the cosmic order, however humble it may appear.",
