  "sanskrit": "यत्तु प्रत्युपकारार्थं फलमुद्दिश्य वा पुनः ।\nदीयते च परिक्लिष्टं तद्दानं राजसं स्मृतम् ॥२१॥",
  "transliteration": "yat tu pratyupakārārthaṁ phalam uddiśya vā punaḥ |\ndīyate ca parikliṣṭaṁ tad dānaṁ rājasaṁ smṛtam ||21||",
  "translation": "That charity which is given with the expectation of a return favor, or with the desire for future reward, or reluctantly and grudgingly, is said to be of the nature of passion (rajasic).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes rajasic or passionate charity, which is the second category in Krishna's classification of giving. Unlike sattvic charity which is pure and selfless, rajasic charity is motivated by self-interest and expectation. The giver either expects something in return (pratyupakāra), desires some future benefit or reward (phala), or gives reluctantly and with mental disturbance (parikliṣṭa). Such giving may appear charitable on the surface, but it is tainted by ego, desire, and calculation.\n\nThe key characteristic of rajasic charity is that it binds the giver to the fruits of action rather than liberating them. When one gives expecting recognition, reciprocation, or heavenly rewards, the act becomes a transaction rather than true charity. The term 'parikliṣṭa' is particularly significant—it indicates that the giving is accompanied by mental affliction, hesitation, or regret. The giver may feel burdened by the act or may give only to maintain social status or fulfill obligations. This stands in stark contrast to the joyful, spontaneous giving characteristic of sattva.\n\nIn the broader context of Chapter 17's discussion of faith and its threefold manifestations, this verse illustrates how the quality of one's faith determines the quality of one's actions. Rajasic faith leads to actions performed with attachment and desire for results, creating karmic bondage rather than spiritual progress. Understanding this distinction helps spiritual aspirants purify their motivations and gradually elevate their consciousness from rajas to sattva.",
