  "translation": "Perceiving through all the senses, yet devoid of all senses; unattached, yet sustaining all; free from the gunas (qualities of nature), yet the experiencer of the gunas.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the paradoxical nature of the Supreme Self (Paramatman) or the Knower of the Field. Krishna presents the transcendent reality through a series of apparent contradictions that point to a truth beyond ordinary comprehension. The Self illuminates all sensory experiences and appears to function through the senses, yet it remains completely distinct from them, being of a different order of reality altogether. It is the consciousness that enables all perception without being limited by any sensory apparatus.\n\nThe verse continues with more paradoxes: the Self is completely unattached to anything in the material world, yet it sustains and supports all existence as the underlying substratum. It is beyond the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) that constitute all of material nature, yet it appears to experience the modifications and qualities produced by these gunas through its association with the body-mind complex. These contradictions are resolved when one understands that the Self is the unchanging witness-consciousness, while all experiences, qualities, and modifications belong solely to prakriti (nature) or the field. This teaching is central to Vedantic philosophy and helps the spiritual aspirant distinguish between the eternal Self and the temporary modifications of matter.",
