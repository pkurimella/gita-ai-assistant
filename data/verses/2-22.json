  "translation": "Just as a person casts off worn-out garments and puts on new ones, so does the embodied soul cast off worn-out bodies and enter into new ones.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most famous analogies in the Bhagavad Gita, comparing the changing of bodies by the soul to the changing of clothes by a person. Krishna uses this simple yet profound metaphor to illustrate the eternal nature of the soul (ātman) and the temporary nature of the physical body. Just as we discard old, worn-out clothes without grief and accept new ones with naturalness, the immortal soul similarly discards old bodies and takes on new ones through the process of reincarnation. This comparison makes the abstract concept of transmigration concrete and relatable.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 2, this verse continues Krishna's teaching on the indestructibility of the soul, which began in the previous verses. Krishna is systematically removing Arjuna's grief over killing his relatives by explaining that the true self—the soul—cannot be killed. The body is merely a temporary covering, like a garment, while the soul remains eternal and unchanging. This understanding is fundamental to Vedantic philosophy and forms the basis for Krishna's argument that Arjuna should not grieve for those who will fall in battle.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse extends beyond the immediate context of the battlefield. It establishes the doctrine of reincarnation (saṁsāra) and introduces the concept that our true identity is not the perishable body but the imperishable soul. This teaching encourages detachment from bodily identification and promotes a deeper understanding of one's spiritual nature. The verse also implies that death is not an end but a transition, a natural process in the soul's journey through multiple lifetimes until it achieves liberation (mokṣa).",
