  "sanskrit": "दम्भो दर्पोऽभिमानश्च क्रोधः पारुष्यमेव च |\nअज्ञानं चाभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम् ||४||",
  "transliteration": "dambho darpo'bhimānaśca krodhaḥ pāruṣyameva ca |\najñānaṃ cābhijātasya pārtha sampadamāsurīm ||4||",
  "translation": "Ostentation, arrogance, excessive pride, anger, harshness, and ignorance—these belong to one born with demoniac qualities, O Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna contrasts the divine qualities enumerated in the previous verses with the demoniac qualities (āsurī sampad). He lists six primary characteristics that mark those born with demoniac tendencies: dambha (hypocrisy or ostentation), darpa (arrogance born of wealth or power), abhimāna (excessive pride or self-conceit), krodha (anger), pāruṣya (harshness or cruelty in speech and action), and ajñāna (ignorance of spiritual truths).\n\nThese demoniac qualities stand in stark opposition to the divine qualities described earlier. While divine qualities lead to liberation (moksha) and spiritual evolution, these demoniac traits bind one to material existence and lead to degradation. The term 'abhijātasya' (one born with) indicates that these qualities manifest due to one's past karmic tendencies, though they can be transformed through spiritual practice and self-awareness. Krishna's purpose in delineating these qualities is not to condemn but to help Arjuna recognize and transcend such tendencies.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse lies in its psychological insight into human nature. These six qualities form a interconnected web—ignorance leads to false pride, which breeds arrogance, resulting in anger when one's ego is challenged, expressing itself through harsh behavior and hypocritical conduct. Understanding this progression helps spiritual aspirants identify and uproot these tendencies at their source, which is ajñāna or spiritual ignorance.",
