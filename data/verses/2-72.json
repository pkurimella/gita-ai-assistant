  "transliteration": "eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati |\nsthitvāsyām anta-kāle 'pi brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati ||",
  "translation": "This is the state of dwelling in Brahman, O Partha (Arjuna). Having attained this, one is never again deluded. Being established in this state even at the time of death, one attains liberation in Brahman (Brahma-nirvana).",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 2 summarizes the ultimate goal of the spiritual path described throughout the chapter. The 'brāhmī sthiti' or Brahman-consciousness represents the state of the sthitaprajña (person of steady wisdom) that Krishna has been describing. Once this state is attained, delusion (moha) can never again cloud one's understanding, as one has realized the eternal truth of the Self beyond the dualities of pleasure and pain, gain and loss.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that even if one attains this state at the final moment of life ('anta-kāle'), one achieves brahma-nirvāṇa—complete liberation and merger with the Absolute. This is significant because it shows that the state of consciousness at death is crucial, a theme that will be elaborated in later chapters. The term 'nirvāṇa' here means the extinction of all ignorance and the cessation of the cycle of birth and death, leading to eternal peace in Brahman.\n\nThis verse serves as a powerful conclusion to the Sāṅkhya Yoga chapter, tying together all the teachings about equanimity, self-control, sense restraint, and steady wisdom. It assures the spiritual aspirant that the goal is attainable and that once reached, it is permanent and irreversible. The verse transitions from the theoretical knowledge of the Self to the practical path of yoga that will be explored in subsequent chapters.",
