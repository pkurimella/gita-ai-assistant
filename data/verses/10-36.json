  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations by identifying Himself with various supreme qualities and powers. The first statement is particularly intriguing—Krishna declares Himself to be the gambling (dyūta) of the deceitful. This does not mean He endorses deception, but rather that even in activities that can lead to vice, the underlying power, skill, and attraction belong to Him. This illustrates the non-dual nature of reality where the Divine pervades all phenomena, even those that humans may misuse. The reference to gambling also recalls the fateful dice game in the Mahabharata that led to the Pandavas' exile, showing how even such events serve the divine plan.\n\nKrishna then identifies with tejas (splendor or brilliance) of the brilliant, victory (jaya) itself, and vyavasāya (determination or resolve). These represent the positive, dynamic aspects of divine manifestation in the world. Victory here signifies not mere conquest but the triumph of dharma over adharma, of truth over falsehood. Determination represents the unwavering resolve necessary for spiritual progress and righteous action. Finally, Krishna declares Himself to be the sattva (goodness, purity, or essential nature) of those endowed with sattva. This refers to the quality of purity and harmony that characterizes evolved beings, indicating that all virtue ultimately flows from the Divine source. This verse thus encompasses both the power behind all phenomena and the excellence in virtuous qualities.",
