  "sanskrit": "उदासीनवदासीनो गुणैर्यो न विचाल्यते ।\nगुणा वर्तन्त इत्येव योऽवतिष्ठति नेङ्गते ॥२३॥",
  "transliteration": "udāsīnavad āsīno guṇair yo na vicālyate |\nguṇā vartanta ity eva yo 'vatiṣṭhati neṅgate ||23||",
  "translation": "One who sits like one unconcerned, who is not disturbed by the gunas, who remains firm knowing that the gunas alone operate, and does not waver.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of one who has transcended the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas). Such a person maintains the attitude of a witness (udāsīna), remaining detached like a neutral observer who is unaffected by the play of the gunas in nature. The enlightened soul understands that all activities in the material world are simply interactions between the gunas and their objects, while the true Self remains untouched and separate from these modifications.\n\nThe key quality emphasized here is steadfastness (avatiṣṭhati) in the understanding that 'the gunas alone operate' (guṇā vartanta). This wisdom allows the liberated person to remain unmoved (na vicālyate, na iṅgate) by the dualities of pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor, which are all products of the gunas. By maintaining this witness consciousness, one achieves freedom from identification with the body-mind complex and its experiences, recognizing oneself as the eternal, unchanging consciousness beyond the gunas.",
