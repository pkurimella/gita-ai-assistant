  "transliteration": "eṣā te'bhihitā sāṅkhye buddhir yoge tv imāṁ śṛṇu | buddhyā yukto yayā pārtha karma-bandhaṁ prahāsyasi ||",
  "translation": "This wisdom has been declared to you from the perspective of Sāṅkhya (analytical knowledge); now hear about it from the perspective of Yoga (action). Endowed with this understanding, O Pārtha (Arjuna), you shall cast off the bondage of karma.",
  "commentary": "This pivotal verse marks a major transition in Krishna's teaching. In verses 11-38, Krishna has explained the Sāṅkhya philosophy—the discriminative knowledge of the eternal Self (ātman) versus the perishable body. Now he announces he will teach Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action performed with the right understanding. This verse serves as a bridge between two fundamental approaches to liberation: the path of knowledge (jñāna) and the path of action (karma).\n\nKrishna promises that by applying the buddhi (discriminative intelligence) he is about to explain, Arjuna will be freed from karma-bandha—the bondage created by action. This is significant because it addresses the practical concern of how one can act in the world without accumulating karmic debt. The Sāṅkhya knowledge establishes what is real and eternal, while Karma Yoga teaches how to act in alignment with that knowledge.\n\nThis verse is crucial for understanding the Gita's synthetic approach. Rather than advocating renunciation of action, Krishna will show how knowledge and action can be integrated. The buddhi yoga he introduces is the intelligence that allows one to perform necessary duties while remaining inwardly detached, thus achieving freedom while still engaged in the world. This teaching is particularly relevant for Arjuna, a warrior who cannot simply abandon his duties, and for all householders who must act in the world.",
