  "sanskrit": "य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम्।\nउभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "ya enaṁ vetti hantāraṁ yaś cainaṁ manyate hatam |\nubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate ||",
  "translation": "One who thinks the Self to be the slayer and one who thinks the Self to be slain—both of them do not know the truth. The Self neither slays nor is slain.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the eternal Self (Atman). He declares that both the person who believes the Self can kill and the person who believes the Self can be killed are equally ignorant of the true nature of reality. This ignorance stems from identifying the eternal, immutable Self with the temporary, changeable body. The Self, being eternal and indestructible, transcends all physical actions including killing and being killed.\n\nThis teaching directly addresses Arjuna's moral dilemma on the battlefield. Arjuna is distressed about killing his relatives and teachers, but Krishna is revealing that from the absolute perspective, the eternal essence of these beings cannot be destroyed. The physical body may perish, but the Self remains untouched. This does not advocate violence, but rather points to the metaphysical reality that underlies all existence.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the crucial distinction between the body and the Self, a central theme in Sankhya philosophy. By understanding this distinction, one moves beyond the dualities of action and consequence at the bodily level, and recognizes the unchanging witness consciousness that is never affected by worldly activities. This knowledge forms the foundation for karma yoga—performing one's duty without attachment to results, knowing that the true Self is never implicated in actions.",
