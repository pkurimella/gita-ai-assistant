  "translation": "Surrendering all actions to Me, with consciousness fixed on the Self, free from desire and possessiveness, fight—freed from mental fever.",
  "commentary": "This verse represents Krishna's direct instruction to Arjuna on how to perform action in the spirit of karma yoga. Krishna asks Arjuna to dedicate all his actions to the Divine (mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi saṃnyasya) while maintaining awareness of the Supreme Self (adhyātma-cetasā). This is not mere mechanical dedication, but a profound spiritual orientation where one acts with full consciousness that all actions ultimately belong to and flow from the Divine.\n\nThe verse emphasizes three critical attitudes for the karma yogi: being free from desire for results (nirāśīḥ), free from the sense of 'mine' or possessiveness (nirmamaḥ), and free from mental agitation or anxiety (vigata-jvaraḥ). These qualities transform action from binding karma into liberating yoga. The 'fever' (jvara) refers to the mental disturbance caused by attachment, anxiety about outcomes, and egoistic identification with actions. By cultivating these attitudes, one can engage fully in necessary action—symbolized here by Arjuna's duty to fight—without incurring karmic bondage.\n\nThis verse is pivotal in the Gita's teaching because it synthesizes the path of action (karma yoga) with devotion (bhakti) and knowledge (jñāna). The surrender to Krishna represents devotion, the consciousness of the Self represents knowledge, and the performance of duty represents action. Together, these create an integrated spiritual practice that allows one to remain active in the world while progressing toward liberation.",
