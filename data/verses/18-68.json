  "transliteration": "ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati |\nbhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā mām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ ||",
  "translation": "One who teaches this supreme secret to My devotees, having performed the highest devotion to Me, shall doubtlessly come to Me alone.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna extols the supreme merit of sharing the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita with sincere devotees. This is considered one of the highest forms of devotional service (bhakti) because it propagates divine knowledge and helps others on their spiritual path. The verse emphasizes that such teaching should be done with discrimination—sharing this 'supreme secret' (paramaṁ guhyam) specifically with those who are devotees (mad-bhakteṣu), meaning those who have faith and are receptive to the teachings.\n\nThe promise given here is absolute and unequivocal—'asaṁśayaḥ' means 'without doubt.' One who engages in this service of teaching the Gita to qualified listeners demonstrates the highest devotion and will certainly attain Krishna. This verse comes near the conclusion of the Gita, where Krishna is summarizing the benefits of studying and sharing these teachings. It establishes the tradition of Gita discourse as a sacred practice and emphasizes that sharing spiritual knowledge with the right audience is itself a direct path to liberation. The act of teaching becomes both a means and an expression of supreme devotion, creating a direct connection between the teacher and the Divine.",
