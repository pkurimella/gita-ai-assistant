  "sanskrit": "ये चैव सात्त्विका भावा राजसास्तामसाश्च ये ।\nमत्त एवेति तान्विद्धि न त्वहं तेषु ते मयि ॥१२॥",
  "transliteration": "ye caiva sāttvikā bhāvā rājasās tāmasāś ca ye |\nmatta eveti tān viddhi na tv ahaṁ teṣu te mayi ||12||",
  "translation": "Know that all states of being—whether born of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), or tamas (ignorance)—proceed from Me alone. However, I am not in them; they are in Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna clarifies the relationship between Himself as the Supreme Reality and the three gunas (qualities of material nature). He declares that all mental states, emotions, and conditions of existence arising from the three gunas—sattva (purity, harmony), rajas (activity, passion), and tamas (inertia, darkness)—originate from Him as their ultimate source. This establishes His position as the foundation of all manifest reality.\n\nHowever, Krishna makes a crucial philosophical distinction: while the gunas and their effects emanate from Him, He remains transcendent and unaffected by them. He is not contained within or limited by the gunas, but rather the gunas exist within His infinite consciousness. This illustrates the concept of divine immanence and transcendence—God is the source of all creation yet remains beyond it, untouched by material qualities. This verse prepares the ground for the next verse, which explains how these gunas create delusion that prevents beings from recognizing the Supreme Reality beyond the material manifestations.",
