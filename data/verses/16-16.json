  "sanskrit": "अनेकचित्तविभ्रान्ता मोहजालसमावृताः ।\nप्रसक्ताः कामभोगेषु पतन्ति नरकेऽशुचौ ॥१६॥",
  "transliteration": "aneka-citta-vibhrāntā moha-jāla-samāvṛtāḥ |\nprasaktāḥ kāma-bhogeṣu patanti narake 'śucau ||16||",
  "translation": "Bewildered by many thoughts, entangled in the web of delusion, addicted to the gratification of desires, they fall into a foul hell.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his description of those possessed by demoniac qualities. He describes their mental state as fragmented and confused (aneka-citta-vibhrāntā), pulled in countless directions by various desires and schemes. These individuals are caught in a web of delusion (moha-jāla), unable to perceive reality clearly or understand the true purpose of life. Their minds are constantly occupied with planning and plotting for material gains, sensual pleasures, and worldly achievements.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that such persons become completely attached (prasaktāḥ) to sensual enjoyments (kāma-bhogeṣu), making these pleasures the sole aim of their existence. This addiction to sense gratification becomes all-consuming, leaving no room for spiritual growth or self-reflection. The consequence of this lifestyle is described starkly—they fall into a foul or impure hell (narake aśucau). This hell can be understood both literally as a lower realm of existence after death, and metaphorically as the hellish state of consciousness characterized by anxiety, dissatisfaction, and spiritual degradation that they experience even in this life.\n\nThis verse serves as a warning about the dangers of allowing the mind to become scattered and enslaved by desires. It illustrates how demoniac qualities lead to a downward spiral of consciousness, where one becomes increasingly trapped in ignorance and suffering. The teaching emphasizes the importance of mental discipline, clarity of purpose, and the cultivation of divine qualities as outlined earlier in the chapter.",
