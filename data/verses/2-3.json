  "translation": "O Partha (Arjuna), do not yield to this unmanliness. It does not befit you. Cast off this petty weakness of heart and arise, O scorcher of enemies!",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna delivers a sharp rebuke to Arjuna, addressing him with two significant epithets: 'Pārtha' (son of Pṛthā/Kuntī) and 'Parantapa' (scorcher of enemies). Krishna's words are deliberately strong, calling Arjuna's despondency 'klaibyam' (impotence or unmanliness) and 'kṣudram hṛdaya-daurbalyam' (petty weakness of heart). This harsh language serves a therapeutic purpose—to shock Arjuna out of his emotional paralysis and remind him of his true nature as a warrior.\n\nThe verse marks a crucial turning point in the dialogue. Krishna recognizes that Arjuna's grief, though dressed in philosophical and ethical concerns, is fundamentally a failure of nerve at a critical moment. By calling it 'unbecoming' (na upapadyate), Krishna suggests that this weakness contradicts Arjuna's essential nature and dharma as a kṣatriya. The command 'uttiṣṭha' (arise) is both literal and metaphorical—arise physically to fight, but also arise spiritually from ignorance to knowledge. This sets the stage for the profound teachings that follow, where Krishna will address not just Arjuna's immediate crisis but the fundamental questions of duty, action, and the nature of the self.",
