  "sanskrit": "मानापमानयोस्तुल्यस्तुल्यो मित्रारिपक्षयोः।\nसर्वारम्भपरित्यागी गुणातीतः स उच्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "mānāpamānayos tulyas tulyo mitrāri-pakṣayoḥ |\nsarvārambha-parityāgī guṇātītaḥ sa ucyate ||",
  "translation": "One who is equal in honor and dishonor, equal toward friends and enemies, and who has renounced all undertakings—such a person is said to have transcended the gunas.",
  "commentary": "This verse concludes Krishna's description of the characteristics of one who has transcended the three gunas (gunatita). The person who has risen above the influence of sattva, rajas, and tamas remains perfectly balanced in all dualities of life. Such an individual maintains equanimity whether receiving honor or dishonor, showing no preference or aversion. Similarly, they view friends and enemies with equal vision, not out of indifference, but from a higher spiritual perspective that sees the Divine in all beings.\n\nThe phrase 'sarvārambha-parityāgī' (renouncer of all undertakings) does not mean abandoning all action, but rather renouncing the sense of doership and attachment to the fruits of action. This person acts without ego-driven motivation, performing duties as an offering to the Divine. This state represents the culmination of spiritual practice described in this chapter—complete freedom from the binding influence of the gunas while still functioning in the world. Such a soul has achieved the state of liberation (moksha) even while living in the body (jivanmukti), demonstrating the practical application of transcending the gunas in daily life.",
