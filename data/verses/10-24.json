  "sanskrit": "पुरोधसां च मुख्यं मां विद्धि पार्थ बृहस्पतिम् ।\nसेनानीनामहं स्कन्दः सरसामस्मि सागरः ॥२४॥",
  "transliteration": "purodhasāṁ ca mukhyaṁ māṁ viddhi pārtha bṛhaspatim |\nsenānīnām ahaṁ skandaḥ sarasām asmi sāgaraḥ ||24||",
  "translation": "Among priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief, Brihaspati. Among military commanders, I am Skanda (Kartikeya). Among bodies of water, I am the ocean.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to reveal His divine manifestations across different categories of existence. He identifies Himself with Brihaspati (also known as the preceptor of the gods), representing the highest spiritual wisdom and guidance among all priests and spiritual teachers. Brihaspati symbolizes divine intelligence, eloquence, and the power of sacred knowledge, making him the foremost among those who perform religious ceremonies and guide others spiritually.\n\nKrishna then declares Himself as Skanda (also known as Kartikeya or Murugan), the divine general and son of Shiva, among all military commanders. Skanda represents strategic brilliance, courage, and invincible power in warfare. This manifestation shows that Krishna's presence pervades not only spiritual pursuits but also the realm of righteous warfare and protection of dharma. Finally, among all bodies of water, Krishna identifies with the ocean—the vastest, deepest, and most powerful of all water bodies. The ocean symbolizes infinity, depth, the source and destination of all rivers, and the container of infinite treasures.\n\nThis verse illustrates the principle that Krishna manifests as the supreme excellence in every category of existence. By identifying with the chief priest, the greatest warrior, and the mightiest body of water, Krishna demonstrates that divinity expresses itself through the most excellent and powerful manifestations in each domain. This teaching helps devotees recognize the Divine in the world around them by perceiving excellence and magnificence as reflections of the Supreme Reality.",
