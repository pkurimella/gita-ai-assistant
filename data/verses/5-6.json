  "sanskrit": "संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखमाप्तुमयोगतः।\nयोगयुक्तो मुनिर्ब्रह्म नचिरेणाधिगच्छति॥",
  "transliteration": "saṁnyāsas tu mahā-bāho duḥkham āptum ayogataḥ |\nyoga-yukto munir brahma na cireṇādhigacchati ||",
  "translation": "But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is difficult to attain without yoga. The sage who is established in yoga quickly attains Brahman.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna clarifies an essential distinction between mere renunciation (sannyasa) and renunciation combined with yoga. He addresses Arjuna as 'mighty-armed' (maha-baho), acknowledging his warrior nature while teaching him spiritual wisdom. Krishna explains that attempting to renounce action without the practice of karma yoga leads to suffering and difficulty. Simply abandoning one's duties and withdrawing from the world without proper mental preparation and purification through selfless action creates internal conflict and does not lead to liberation.\n\nThe Lord emphasizes that a muni (sage or contemplative person) who is established in yoga—meaning one who performs actions without attachment, dedicating all work to the Divine—quickly attains Brahman, the ultimate Reality. This verse reinforces the central teaching of this chapter: that karma yoga (the path of selfless action) is not only equal to but actually superior to mere renunciation for most spiritual aspirants. The practice of yoga purifies the mind, removes desires and attachments, and naturally leads to the state of true renunciation where one realizes the Self. This integrated approach of action performed with the right attitude is more practical and effective than premature withdrawal from action, which often results in suppression rather than transcendence of desires.",
