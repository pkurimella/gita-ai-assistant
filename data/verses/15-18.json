  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Supreme Person",
  "sanskrit": "यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तमः।\nअतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथितः पुरुषोत्तमः॥",
  "transliteration": "yasmāt kṣaram atīto 'ham akṣarād api cottamaḥ |\nato 'smi loke vede ca prathitaḥ puruṣottamaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Since I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as the Supreme Person (Purushottama).",
  "commentary": "This verse represents the culmination of Krishna's teaching about the three purushas (persons) described in this chapter. Having explained the kshara purusha (perishable being - the material world and embodied souls), and the akshara purusha (imperishable being - the eternal soul in its pure state), Krishna now declares His supreme position as Purushottama - the Supreme Person who transcends both. He is beyond the perishable material nature and even superior to the imperishable individual soul, being the source and sustainer of both.\n\nThe term 'Purushottama' literally means 'the best of persons' or 'the Supreme Person.' Krishna states that this is not merely His claim but is recognized both in common understanding ('loke') and in scriptural authority ('vede'). This verse establishes the complete theistic framework of the Gita - there is the material world, the individual soul, and the Supreme Soul who is distinct from and superior to both. This understanding resolves the apparent contradiction between the immanent and transcendent aspects of divinity.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse is profound as it establishes the Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) and Dvaita (dualistic) interpretations of Vedanta, distinguishing the Supreme Lord from both matter and individual souls while maintaining their eternal relationship. This knowledge of Purushottama is considered the essence of Vedic wisdom, as it provides the complete understanding necessary for liberation and devotion.",
