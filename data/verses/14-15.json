  "sanskrit": "रजसि प्रलयं गत्वा कर्मसङ्गिषु जायते ।\nतथा प्रलीनस्तमसि मूढयोनिषु जायते ॥१५॥",
  "transliteration": "rajasi pralayaṁ gatvā karmasaṅgiṣu jāyate |\ntathā pralīnas tamasi mūḍhayoniṣu jāyate ||15||",
  "translation": "Dying in rajas (passion), one is born among those attached to action; dying in tamas (ignorance), one is born in the wombs of the deluded.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's teaching on the consequences of dying under the influence of different gunas. Here He describes the fate of those who die while rajas or tamas predominates in their consciousness. One who dies when rajas is dominant takes birth among those who are intensely attached to action (karmasaṅgiṣu) - people driven by desires, ambitions, and restless activity. Such births occur in families and circumstances where passionate pursuit of worldly goals is the primary focus.\n\nEven more unfortunate is the fate of one who dies in tamas. Such a person is born in mūḍhayoniṣu - the wombs of the deluded or ignorant species. This refers to births in lower forms of life characterized by ignorance, such as animal species or among humans in conditions of extreme delusion and darkness. This verse emphasizes the critical importance of one's mental state at death, which is determined by the predominant guna cultivated throughout life. It serves as a warning about the consequences of allowing rajas and tamas to dominate one's consciousness, and implicitly encourages the cultivation of sattva as the foundation for spiritual progress and ultimately transcendence of all three gunas.",
