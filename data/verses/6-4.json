  "translation": "When one is not attached to sense objects or to actions, having renounced all desires and intentions, then one is said to have ascended to yoga (yogārūḍha).",
  "commentary": "This verse defines the state of one who has successfully ascended to the heights of yoga practice. Krishna describes the yogārūḍha (one established in yoga) as someone who has achieved complete detachment from both sense objects and the fruits of actions. The key characteristic is the renunciation of all saṅkalpas (desires, intentions, and mental modifications). This is not merely external renunciation but an internal state where the mind no longer clings to sensory experiences or becomes entangled in the results of one's duties.\n\nThe verse establishes an important milestone in spiritual practice. While the previous verse spoke of yoga as the means to ascend, this verse describes what it means to have reached that elevated state. The yogārūḍha has transcended the pull of the senses and the binding nature of action through karma. This state is characterized by equanimity and freedom from the constant agitation caused by desires and expectations. It represents the culmination of the preliminary stages of yoga practice, where the practitioner has gained mastery over the modifications of the mind and established themselves in steady wisdom, preparing for deeper states of meditation and self-realization.",
