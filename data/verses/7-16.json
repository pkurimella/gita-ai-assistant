  "transliteration": "catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛtino'rjuna |\nārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha ||",
  "translation": "Four kinds of virtuous people worship Me, O Arjuna: the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise, O best of the Bharatas.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna categorizes devotees into four types based on their motivations for approaching the Divine. The first category is the ārtaḥ (distressed), those who turn to God in times of suffering or crisis. The second is the jijñāsuḥ (seeker of knowledge), those driven by spiritual curiosity and the desire to understand the nature of reality. The third is the arthārthī (seeker of wealth or material goals), those who worship God for worldly prosperity and fulfillment of desires. The fourth and highest is the jñānī (the wise), those who worship God out of pure love and understanding, having realized the ultimate truth.\n\nKrishna significantly notes that all four types are sukṛtinaḥ (virtuous or pious), indicating that any sincere approach to the Divine is meritorious and stems from accumulated good karma from past lives. This inclusive perspective demonstrates that devotion at any level is valuable and represents spiritual progress. Even those who approach God with material desires are on a spiritual path, as their faith itself purifies them over time. However, among these four, Krishna will later indicate that the jñānī is especially dear to Him, as this devotee seeks God for God's sake alone, not for any external benefit. This verse establishes an important principle in bhakti (devotion) that God accepts all sincere seekers regardless of their initial motivation, while also suggesting a hierarchy of spiritual maturity.",
