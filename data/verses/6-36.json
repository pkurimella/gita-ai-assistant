  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna responds to Arjuna's earlier question about the fate of the unsuccessful yogi. Here, Krishna makes a crucial distinction between two types of spiritual aspirants. He acknowledges that for those who have not gained control over their mind and senses (asaṁyatātmanā), the path of yoga is indeed extremely difficult to traverse. The uncontrolled mind, constantly pulled by desires and distractions, makes steady spiritual progress nearly impossible.\n\nHowever, Krishna offers hope and encouragement by stating that for one who has achieved self-mastery (vaśyātmanā) and continues to strive with proper methods (upāyataḥ), success in yoga is definitely attainable. The word 'upāyataḥ' is significant—it indicates that success requires not just effort, but the right approach, proper guidance, and appropriate techniques. This verse emphasizes that self-control is not merely helpful but essential for spiritual progress. Krishna's use of 'me matiḥ' (My opinion) carries divine authority, assuring the aspirant that this is the definitive truth about the spiritual path. The verse serves as both a warning against complacency and an encouragement that with proper discipline and method, even the most challenging spiritual goals are within reach.",
