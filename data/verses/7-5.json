  "translation": "This is My lower nature. But know, O mighty-armed Arjuna, that beyond this is My higher nature (Prakriti), which comprises the life-principle (jiva) by which this universe is sustained.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna makes a crucial distinction between His two types of Prakriti (nature or energy). Having described the eight-fold material nature in the previous verse as His lower nature (apara prakriti), He now introduces His superior nature (para prakriti). This higher nature is identified with the jiva or the conscious life-principle that animates all living beings. While the lower nature consists of inert material elements, the higher nature is the conscious spiritual energy that gives life and sustains the entire universe.\n\nThis verse establishes a fundamental principle of Vedantic philosophy: the distinction between matter (jada) and spirit (chit). The material elements, though divine in origin, are unconscious and inert. The jiva-shakti or life-force is conscious and superior, being closer to the ultimate reality. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'maha-baho' (mighty-armed), perhaps to encourage him to grasp this profound metaphysical teaching. The verse emphasizes that both natures belong to Krishna, establishing His position as the source of both the material and spiritual dimensions of existence. This understanding is essential for comprehending how the Divine pervades and sustains all creation through these two distinct yet interconnected energies.",
