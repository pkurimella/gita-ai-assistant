  "sanskrit": "कस्माच्च ते न नमेरन्महात्मन् गरीयसे ब्रह्मणोऽप्यादिकर्त्रे |\nअनन्त देवेश जगन्निवास त्वमक्षरं सदसत्तत्परं यत् ||",
  "transliteration": "kasmāc ca te na nameran mahātman garīyase brahmaṇo 'py ādi-kartre |\nananta deveśa jagan-nivāsa tvam akṣaraṁ sad-asat tat-paraṁ yat ||",
  "translation": "O Great Soul, why should they not bow to You, who are greater than all, the original creator even of Brahma? O Infinite One, O Lord of the gods, O Abode of the universe, You are the imperishable, the being and non-being, and that which is beyond both.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna explains why all beings, including the greatest gods and sages, prostrate before Krishna's universal form. He addresses Krishna with profound reverence, acknowledging Him as Mahātman (Great Soul) and recognizing that even Brahma, the creator deity, owes his existence to Krishna as the ādi-kartā (original creator). This establishes Krishna's supreme position in the cosmic hierarchy.\n\nArjuna uses multiple epithets to describe Krishna's transcendental nature: Ananta (infinite), Deveśa (Lord of gods), and Jagannivāsa (abode of the universe). Most significantly, he identifies Krishna as akṣara (imperishable) and as transcending both sat (being/manifest) and asat (non-being/unmanifest). This points to the Vedantic understanding that the Supreme Reality is beyond all dualities and conceptual categories. The phrase 'tat-paraṁ yat' indicates that Krishna is even beyond the distinction between existence and non-existence, representing the absolute Brahman that is the substratum of all reality. This verse thus provides a theological justification for the universal worship and reverence that Arjuna witnesses in the cosmic vision.",
