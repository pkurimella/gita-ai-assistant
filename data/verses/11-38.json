  "sanskrit": "त्वमादिदेवः पुरुषः पुराणस्त्वमस्य विश्वस्य परं निधानम्।\nवेत्तासि वेद्यं च परं च धाम त्वया ततं विश्वमनन्तरूप॥",
  "transliteration": "tvam ādi-devaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇas tvam asya viśvasya paraṃ nidhānam|\nvettāsi vedyaṃ ca paraṃ ca dhāma tvayā tataṃ viśvam ananta-rūpa||",
  "translation": "You are the primal God, the ancient Purusha; You are the supreme refuge of this universe. You are the knower, the knowable, and the supreme abode. By You alone is this universe pervaded, O One of infinite forms.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his hymn of praise after witnessing Krishna's cosmic form. He acknowledges Krishna as the ādi-deva (primordial deity) and purāṇa puruṣa (ancient, eternal being), recognizing that Krishna existed before all creation and is the source from which everything emanates. Arjuna declares Krishna as the ultimate refuge (paraṃ nidhānam) of the entire universe, the final resting place to which all beings return.\n\nArjuna further recognizes the epistemological completeness of Krishna - He is simultaneously the knower (vettā), the known (vedyam), and the supreme abode (paraṃ dhāma). This trinity represents the complete collapse of subject-object duality in the ultimate reality. Krishna encompasses both the process of knowing and that which is to be known, transcending the ordinary limitations of consciousness. The verse concludes by affirming that the entire universe is pervaded (tatam) by Krishna's presence, and addresses Him as ananta-rūpa (one of infinite forms), acknowledging that while Krishna has revealed this particular cosmic form, His manifestations are truly limitless and beyond complete comprehension.",
