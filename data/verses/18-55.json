  "transliteration": "bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ |\ntato māṁ tattvato jñātvā viśate tad-anantaram ||55||",
  "translation": "Through devotion one truly comes to know Me, what My measure is and who I am in essence. Then, having known Me in truth, one immediately enters into Me.",
  "commentary": "This verse reveals the supreme means of attaining the ultimate reality—bhakti or devotion. Krishna declares that it is through pure devotion that one can truly know Him in His essential nature (tattvataḥ), understanding both His magnitude (yāvān) and His true identity (yaḥ asmi). This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential and transformative, arising from the heart's complete surrender and love.\n\nThe verse establishes a clear progression: first comes devotion (bhakti), then comes true knowledge (jñāna) of the Divine, and finally comes union or entry (viśate) into the Supreme. The word 'tad-anantaram' (immediately thereafter) indicates that once true knowledge dawns through devotion, liberation follows without delay. This emphasizes that devotion is not opposed to knowledge but is the very means to the highest knowledge.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18, this verse represents the culmination of Krishna's teaching, showing that all paths—karma yoga, jñāna yoga, and bhakti yoga—ultimately converge in devotional surrender. It affirms that the transcendent Absolute can only be known through love and devotion, not through mere intellectual effort or ritualistic practice alone. This verse bridges the personal and impersonal aspects of the Divine, showing that the Supreme Reality, while beyond comprehension, becomes accessible through the grace that flows from sincere devotion.",
