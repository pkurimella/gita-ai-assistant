  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Krishna, what is the destination of the person who possesses faith but lacks self-control, whose mind wanders away from yoga, and who fails to attain perfection in yoga?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna poses a deeply practical and compassionate question that reflects the concerns of sincere spiritual aspirants. He asks about the fate of one who begins the spiritual path with faith (śraddhā) but whose mind becomes distracted and who fails to achieve complete yogic perfection in this lifetime. This question reveals Arjuna's understanding that the path of meditation is challenging and that many may falter despite their initial sincerity and effort. The term 'ayatiḥ' refers to one who lacks complete self-control or discipline, while 'calita-mānasaḥ' describes a mind that has deviated or wandered from the yogic path.\n\nThis question is significant within the context of Chapter 6, which deals extensively with the practice of meditation and the qualities required for success in yoga. Arjuna's concern is whether such a person, having fallen between two worlds—neither achieving worldly success nor spiritual perfection—might be lost like a scattered cloud, destroyed in both realms. This verse sets up one of the most reassuring teachings in the Gita, where Krishna will explain that no sincere spiritual effort is ever wasted. The question demonstrates Arjuna's role as the representative of all spiritual seekers who face doubts and obstacles on the path, and his inquiry allows Krishna to address a universal human concern about spiritual failure and divine grace.",
