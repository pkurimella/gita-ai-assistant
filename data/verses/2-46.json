  "translation": "Whatever purpose is served by a small well when there is a flood of water everywhere, the same purpose is served by all the Vedas for an enlightened Brahmana who has realized the Supreme Truth.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna uses a powerful analogy to illustrate the relative value of Vedic rituals for one who has attained true knowledge. Just as a small well becomes redundant when a vast reservoir or flood waters are available everywhere, the limited purposes served by Vedic rituals become unnecessary for one who has realized the ultimate truth. The well serves a purpose when water is scarce, but when abundant water is available on all sides, the well's utility is superseded by the greater source.\n\nThis does not mean Krishna is dismissing the Vedas as worthless. Rather, he is establishing a hierarchy of spiritual understanding. The Vedas serve an important purpose for those still engaged in ritualistic worship and seeking material or heavenly rewards. However, for the enlightened knower of Brahman (vijānataḥ brāhmaṇasya), who has direct realization of the Supreme Reality, the limited goals of Vedic karma-kanda (ritualistic portion) are transcended. Such a person has access to the infinite ocean of divine knowledge and bliss.\n\nThis verse is crucial in the context of Chapter 2, where Krishna is transitioning Arjuna from a limited understanding based on social duty and ritualism to a higher vision based on Self-knowledge and yoga. It prepares the ground for understanding that true wisdom lies not in mechanical performance of rituals, but in direct realization of one's eternal nature. The enlightened person naturally fulfills all purposes that the Vedas aim to achieve, just as one with access to an ocean need not depend on a well.",
