  "transliteration": "yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ yogī vigata-kalmaṣaḥ |\nsukhena brahma-saṁsparśam atyantaṁ sukham aśnute ||",
  "translation": "Thus constantly engaging the mind in the Self, the yogi, freed from all impurities, easily attains the supreme bliss of contact with Brahman (the Absolute).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the culmination of the yoga practice outlined in this chapter. The yogi who has steadily practiced controlling the mind and fixing it on the Self becomes free from all impurities (vigata-kalmaṣaḥ) - the mental afflictions, karmic residues, and ignorance that bind the soul. Through this purification and constant practice, the yogi naturally and effortlessly (sukhena) experiences direct contact with Brahman, the ultimate reality.\n\nThe phrase 'brahma-saṁsparśa' (contact with Brahman) indicates not merely intellectual understanding but direct experiential realization of one's unity with the Supreme. This is described as 'atyantaṁ sukham' - the supreme, infinite bliss that transcends all worldly pleasures. This bliss is not temporary or dependent on external circumstances but is the eternal nature of the Self when realized in its pure state. The verse emphasizes that this supreme state is achieved through consistent practice (sadā - always, constantly) rather than sporadic effort, highlighting the importance of regularity and dedication in spiritual practice as discussed throughout Chapter 6.",
