  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Chapter 7, which is considered a pivotal point in the Bhagavad Gita. Having established the foundations of karma yoga, jnana yoga, and dhyana yoga in the previous chapters, Krishna now promises to reveal the complete knowledge of His true nature. The verse emphasizes three essential prerequisites for this knowledge: attachment of the mind to the Divine (āsakta-manāḥ), the practice of yoga (yogaṁ yuñjan), and taking complete refuge in Krishna (mad-āśrayaḥ).\n\nKrishna's promise to reveal complete knowledge (samagraṁ) without any doubt (asaṁśayaṁ) is significant. This chapter will integrate both theoretical knowledge (jñāna) and experiential realization (vijñāna) of the Divine. The emphasis on 'without doubt' indicates that this knowledge will be so comprehensive and direct that it will remove all uncertainties about the nature of reality, God, and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supreme. This verse sets the stage for understanding both the manifest and unmanifest aspects of the Divine, the material and spiritual energies, and how everything in existence is connected to and sustained by the Supreme Reality.",
