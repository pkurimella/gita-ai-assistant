  "translation": "He who knows Me as the unborn, without beginning, and the Supreme Lord of all the worlds—he, undeluded among mortals, is freed from all sins.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the profound benefit of truly knowing His divine nature. He describes Himself with three essential attributes: 'aja' (unborn), 'anādi' (without beginning), and 'loka-maheśvara' (the Supreme Lord of all worlds). This knowledge is not merely intellectual understanding but a deep realization of Krishna's transcendental nature—that He is beyond birth and death, eternal, and the ultimate controller of all existence. Such knowledge distinguishes the wise from the deluded.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that one who possesses this understanding is 'asammūḍha' (undeluded) among mortals. This person sees through the illusion of material existence and recognizes the Supreme Reality. The result of this knowledge is liberation from all sins ('sarva-pāpaiḥ pramucyate'). This doesn't mean merely the forgiveness of past wrongdoings, but a fundamental transformation where one transcends the very capacity to accrue karmic bondage. The verse establishes that true knowledge of the Divine nature is itself liberating, as it removes the ignorance that is the root cause of all suffering and bondage. This sets the stage for Krishna's subsequent elaboration of His divine manifestations, helping Arjuna develop this saving knowledge.",
