  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Three Divisions of Faith",
  "sanskrit": "तस्मादोमित्युदाहृत्य यज्ञदानतपःक्रियाः।\nप्रवर्तन्ते विधानोक्ताः सततं ब्रह्मवादिनाम्॥",
  "transliteration": "tasmād om ity udāhṛtya yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyāḥ |\npravartante vidhānoktāḥ satataṁ brahma-vādinām ||",
  "translation": "Therefore, the acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity prescribed in the scriptures are always begun by those who understand the Absolute Truth with the utterance of 'Om'.",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces the sacred syllable 'Om' as the essential prefix to all spiritual practices. Krishna explains that those who are knowers of Brahman (brahma-vādinām) - the seekers and knowers of the Absolute Truth - always commence their prescribed religious duties with the utterance of Om. This practice sanctifies the acts of yajña (sacrifice), dāna (charity), and tapas (austerity), connecting them to the Supreme Reality. The word 'tasmāt' (therefore) links this verse to the previous discussion about the three types of faith and their expressions.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that Om is not merely a ritualistic sound but represents the Supreme Brahman itself. By beginning spiritual practices with Om, practitioners acknowledge the divine presence and dedicate their actions to the Ultimate Reality rather than performing them for personal gain. The term 'vidhānoktāḥ' indicates that these practices must be performed according to scriptural injunctions, not arbitrarily. The word 'satatam' (always) stresses the consistent and unwavering practice of this principle by true spiritual aspirants. This verse sets the foundation for understanding the threefold division of Om-Tat-Sat, which represents different aspects of approaching the Divine through various spiritual practices.",
