  "sanskrit": "नाहं वेदैर्न तपसा न दानेन न चेज्यया ।\nशक्य एवंविधो द्रष्टुं दृष्टवानसि मां यथा ॥५३॥",
  "transliteration": "nāhaṁ vedair na tapasā na dānena na cejyayā |\nśakya evaṁvidho draṣṭuṁ dṛṣṭavān asi māṁ yathā ||53||",
  "translation": "Not by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by charity, nor by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as you have seen Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the extraordinary nature of the vision He has just granted to Arjuna. He declares that the cosmic form (Viśvarūpa) cannot be perceived through conventional means of spiritual practice such as Vedic study, austerities (tapas), charitable giving (dāna), or ritual sacrifices (yajña). These traditional paths, while valuable, are insufficient to grant the direct vision of God's universal form that Arjuna has just witnessed.\n\nThis statement underscores the supremacy of divine grace over human effort. Krishna is preparing to reveal in the next verse that only through single-minded devotion (ananya-bhakti) can one truly perceive and know Him in His transcendent reality. The verse serves as a bridge between the terrifying vision of the universal form and Krishna's return to His gentle, four-armed and then two-armed form. It highlights that the ultimate spiritual realization comes not merely through ritualistic practices or intellectual study, but through the Lord's grace combined with pure devotion.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in establishing the hierarchy of spiritual practices. While the Vedas, austerities, charity, and sacrifices are all legitimate spiritual paths mentioned throughout the Gita, this verse reveals their limitation in granting the highest vision. This prepares the ground for the supremacy of bhakti (devotion) that will be elaborated in subsequent verses and reaches its culmination in Chapter 18.",
