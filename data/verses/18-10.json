  "sanskrit": "न द्वेष्ट्यकुशलं कर्म कुशले नानुषज्जते।\nत्यागी सत्त्वसमाविष्टो मेधावी छिन्नसंशयः॥",
  "transliteration": "na dveṣṭy akuśalaṁ karma kuśale nānuṣajjate |\ntyāgī sattva-samāviṣṭo medhāvī chinna-saṁśayaḥ ||",
  "translation": "One who neither hates disagreeable work nor is attached to agreeable work, who is endowed with sattva (goodness), intelligent, and free from all doubts—such a person is a true renunciant.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of a true tyagi (renunciant) who has attained the highest state of equanimity. Such a person performs their duties without being affected by the pleasant or unpleasant nature of the work. They do not hate tasks that are disagreeable or difficult, nor do they become attached to work that is pleasant or brings recognition. This mental equilibrium is the hallmark of spiritual maturity.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that a genuine renunciant is established in sattva-guna (the mode of goodness), possesses discrimination (medhavi), and has resolved all doubts through knowledge. This person understands the true nature of action and renunciation as taught throughout the Gita. They recognize that all actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti, and the Self remains untouched. This understanding frees them from both aversion and attachment, allowing them to perform their duties with perfect equanimity and wisdom, which is the essence of karma yoga combined with true renunciation.",
