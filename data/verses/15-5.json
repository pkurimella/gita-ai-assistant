  "translation": "Those who are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the evil of attachment, who dwell constantly in the Self, whose desires have completely ceased, who are liberated from the dualities known as pleasure and pain—such undeluded souls attain that eternal Supreme Abode.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the qualifications and characteristics of those who attain the Supreme Abode (padam avyayam), continuing the metaphor of the inverted tree from the previous verses. Krishna outlines the spiritual qualities necessary to transcend the material world: freedom from false pride (nirmāna) and delusion (moha), victory over attachment (jita-saṅga-doṣa), constant dwelling in spiritual consciousness (adhyātma-nitya), complete cessation of material desires (vinivṛtta-kāma), and liberation from the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain (dvandva).\n\nThe verse emphasizes that liberation is not merely a matter of intellectual understanding but requires a complete transformation of consciousness. Those who are 'amūḍhāḥ' (undeluded) see through the illusions of material existence and recognize the temporary nature of worldly experiences. By remaining established in the Self and transcending the dualities that bind ordinary consciousness, they become eligible for the eternal abode. This state represents the culmination of the spiritual journey described in the Gita—moving from the entangling roots of the material tree to the imperishable foundation of divine reality.\n\nThe qualities mentioned here are both the means and the signs of spiritual advancement. They represent a progressive detachment from material identification and a deepening absorption in transcendental consciousness. This verse serves as a practical guide for aspirants, showing that the path to the Supreme requires systematic cultivation of virtues and the elimination of binding tendencies rooted in ego and desire.",
