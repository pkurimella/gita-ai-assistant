  "translation": "O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn from Me the five causes for the accomplishment of all actions, as declared in the Sankhya philosophy which deals with the end of all actions.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna introduces the five factors necessary for the accomplishment of any action, as taught in the Sankhya system of philosophy. The term 'kṛtānte' (end of action) refers to the Sankhya philosophy's comprehensive analysis of action and its cessation. Krishna is about to enumerate these five causes in the subsequent verses, providing Arjuna with a complete understanding of how actions are performed and completed. This knowledge is essential for understanding karma and ultimately transcending it.\n\nThe reference to Sankhya here is significant as it represents one of the oldest philosophical systems in Indian thought, which provides a detailed analysis of the constituents of action. By understanding these five factors—the body (seat of action), the doer, the various senses, the different kinds of efforts, and divine providence—one gains insight into the mechanics of karma. This understanding is crucial for the path of renunciation being discussed in this final chapter, as true renunciation comes from knowledge of how actions bind us and how to perform them without attachment.",
