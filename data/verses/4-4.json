  "translation": "Your birth is recent, while the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun-god) was in the ancient past. How am I to understand that You instructed this yoga to him in the beginning?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his natural confusion upon hearing Krishna's statement in the previous verse that He taught this imperishable yoga to Vivasvan at the beginning of creation. Arjuna points out the apparent chronological impossibility: Krishna's birth as a human being occurred only recently in Mathura, whereas Vivasvan, the Sun-god, existed at the very dawn of creation. This question reflects the rational doubt of any sincere seeker who hears such a claim.\n\nArjuna's question serves as a perfect setup for Krishna to reveal one of the most profound teachings of the Gita—the doctrine of divine incarnation (avatāra). This verse demonstrates Arjuna's role as the ideal disciple who asks questions on behalf of all humanity. His doubt is not born of disrespect but of genuine desire to understand the truth. The question allows Krishna to explain the mystery of His eternal nature versus His temporal manifestations, leading to the famous discourse on divine incarnation in the subsequent verses. This exchange illustrates the pedagogical method of the Gita, where apparent contradictions are resolved through deeper spiritual knowledge, moving the student from superficial understanding to profound realization of metaphysical truths.",
