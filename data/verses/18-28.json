  "sanskrit": "अयुक्तः प्राकृतः स्तब्धः शठो नैष्कृतिकोऽलसः।\nविषादी दीर्घसूत्री च कर्ता तामस उच्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "ayuktaḥ prākṛtaḥ stabdhaḥ śaṭho naiṣkṛtiko'lasaḥ |\nviṣādī dīrghasūtrī ca kartā tāmasa ucyate ||",
  "translation": "The doer who is undisciplined, vulgar, obstinate, deceitful, malicious, lazy, despondent, and procrastinating is said to be tamasic (in the mode of ignorance).",
  "commentary": "This verse completes Krishna's analysis of the three types of doers (kartas) by describing the tamasic agent. Such a person is characterized by eight negative qualities that obstruct spiritual progress and worldly success alike. The tamasic doer is ayukta (undisciplined, not connected to higher purpose), prakrita (crude, vulgar in behavior), stabdha (obstinate, rigid), shatha (deceitful), naishkritika (malicious, wishing harm to others), alasa (lazy), vishadi (despondent, depressed), and dīrghasūtrī (procrastinating, delaying action).\n\nThese characteristics represent the lowest mode of action, where the agent is completely dominated by ignorance, inertia, and negativity. Unlike the sattvic doer who acts with discipline and detachment, or even the rajasic doer who acts with passion and ego, the tamasic doer is trapped in delusion and harmful tendencies. Such a person not only fails to progress spiritually but also causes harm to themselves and others through their actions. This verse serves as a warning about the qualities to be avoided and transcended on the spiritual path, emphasizing the importance of cultivating awareness and discipline in all undertakings.",
