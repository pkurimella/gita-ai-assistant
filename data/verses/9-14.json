  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of devoted seekers who worship Him with unwavering dedication. The verse outlines four key practices: constant glorification (kīrtana), steadfast effort with firm vows (dṛḍha-vratāḥ), reverential prostration, and continuous yogic union. These devotees maintain an unbroken connection with the Divine through multiple forms of spiritual practice, demonstrating that true devotion is not passive but actively engaged.\n\nThe term 'satataṁ' (always) emphasizes the continuous nature of their practice, indicating that devotion is not confined to specific times or places but permeates every aspect of life. The 'dṛḍha-vratāḥ' (firm in vows) suggests unwavering determination despite obstacles or distractions. This verse represents the path of bhakti-yoga in its fullest expression, where the devotee's entire existence becomes an offering to the Divine. The combination of glorification, effort, reverence, and constant union creates a comprehensive spiritual practice that engages the body, speech, and mind in worship, leading to complete absorption in the Divine consciousness.",
