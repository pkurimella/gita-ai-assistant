  "transliteration": "mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham udbhavaś ca bhaviṣyatām |\nkīrtiḥ śrīr vāk ca nārīṇāṁ smṛtir medhā dhṛtiḥ kṣamā ||34||",
  "translation": "I am all-devouring death, and I am the origin of all things yet to be. Among feminine qualities, I am fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness, and forgiveness.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents two contrasting aspects of His divine manifestation. First, He identifies Himself as death (mṛtyu) that takes away everything, representing the inevitable dissolution that awaits all created things. Yet simultaneously, He is the source (udbhava) of all that is yet to come into being, showing His role as both destroyer and creator. This dual nature emphasizes the cyclical nature of existence and Krishna's transcendence beyond the dualities of creation and destruction.\n\nThe second half of the verse lists seven feminine qualities (nārīṇām) through which the Divine manifests. These are not merely attributes of women, but represent universal virtues personified in feminine form according to Sanskrit grammar. Fame (kīrti) represents lasting recognition of noble deeds; prosperity (śrī) signifies abundance and grace; speech (vāk) represents the power of expression and communication; memory (smṛti) is the faculty of retention and recollection; intelligence (medhā) is discriminative wisdom; steadfastness (dhṛti) is unwavering determination; and forgiveness (kṣamā) is the capacity to pardon and transcend resentment. Together, these qualities represent the highest virtues that sustain dharma and enable spiritual evolution, all of which are manifestations of the Supreme.",
