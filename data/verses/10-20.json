  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Krishna's enumeration of His divine manifestations (vibhūtis). Before describing His specific manifestations in the phenomenal world, Krishna establishes the fundamental truth that He is the innermost Self (Ātmā) dwelling in the hearts of all beings. By addressing Arjuna as Gudakesha (conqueror of sleep), Krishna emphasizes the need for spiritual alertness to comprehend this profound teaching. The term 'āśaya-sthitaḥ' indicates that the Divine resides in the innermost chamber of every being's consciousness, as the witness and support of all mental modifications.\n\nThe second line presents the temporal aspect of Krishna's all-pervasiveness. He is not merely present in beings spatially, but also temporally—as their origin (ādi), sustenance (madhya), and dissolution (anta). This declaration encompasses the entire cycle of existence, affirming that nothing exists independent of the Divine reality. This verse serves as the foundational principle for all the specific manifestations that follow in subsequent verses. It establishes that whatever excellence or glory exists in any form is ultimately a manifestation of the one Supreme Reality, making devotion to any genuine excellence a form of worship of the Divine itself.",
