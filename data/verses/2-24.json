  "transliteration": "acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam akledyo 'śoṣya eva ca |\nnityaḥ sarvagataḥ sthāṇur acalo 'yaṁ sanātanaḥ ||",
  "translation": "This Self cannot be cut, nor burned, nor wetted, nor dried. It is eternal, all-pervading, unchanging, immovable, and primordial.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his exposition on the indestructible nature of the Atman (Self). He systematically negates the possibility of the Self being affected by the four primary elements—earth (cutting), fire (burning), water (wetting), and air (drying). This demonstrates that the Self transcends all material elements and their interactions. The verse establishes that no physical force or elemental power can damage or alter the essential nature of the soul.\n\nKrishna then provides five positive attributes of the Self: nitya (eternal), sarvagata (all-pervading), sthāṇu (unchanging/stable), acala (immovable), and sanātana (primordial/ancient). These qualities emphasize the transcendental nature of consciousness that exists beyond time, space, and causation. The term 'sarvagata' indicates that the Self is omnipresent, not confined to the body, while 'sthāṇu' suggests it is like a mountain—firm and unshakeable.\n\nThis teaching is crucial in the context of Arjuna's grief over killing his relatives in battle. Krishna is establishing that the real Self of these individuals cannot be killed, as it is beyond all physical processes. This philosophical foundation helps Arjuna understand that death is merely a transformation of the body, not the destruction of the eternal soul. The verse reinforces the central Vedantic teaching that our true identity is not the perishable body but the imperishable consciousness that animates it.",
