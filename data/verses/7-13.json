  "translation": "Deluded by these three states composed of the gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), this entire world does not recognize Me, who am beyond them and imperishable.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains why most beings fail to perceive His true divine nature. The entire world is bewildered by the three gunas—sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance)—which constitute all phenomenal existence. These three qualities of material nature create various mental and emotional states that cloud human perception and understanding. People become so absorbed in the dualities and modifications produced by these gunas that they cannot see beyond the material manifestation to recognize the Supreme Reality.\n\nKrishna declares that He transcends these three gunas and remains eternally unchanging (avyaya). While the entire creation is subject to constant transformation under the influence of the gunas, the Supreme Lord remains beyond their reach. This verse addresses a fundamental problem in spiritual life: the inability of conditioned souls to recognize the Divine due to their identification with material nature. The delusion (moha) caused by the gunas acts as a veil that prevents direct perception of the transcendent reality. This sets up the following verse where Krishna will explain that only through divine grace and devotion can one transcend this powerful illusion of maya and come to know the Supreme Truth.",
