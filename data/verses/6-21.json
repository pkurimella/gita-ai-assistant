  "transliteration": "sukham ātyāntikaṁ yat tad buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam |\nvetti yatra na caivāyaṁ sthitaś calati tattvataḥ ||21||",
  "translation": "That supreme bliss which is perceived by the purified intellect and which transcends the senses—knowing which, established in this state, one never moves from the Truth.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the transcendental experience of the yogi who has attained the highest state of meditation. The bliss (sukha) mentioned here is not ordinary sensory pleasure but ātyāntika—absolute, infinite, and eternal. This supreme happiness is buddhi-grāhya, meaning it can only be grasped by the purified intellect or higher understanding, not through the physical senses (atīndriya). This distinguishes spiritual bliss from material pleasure, which depends on sense contact with objects.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the stability and permanence of this realization. Once a yogi experiences this transcendental state and becomes established in it, they do not waver from the Truth (tattva). This unwavering steadiness indicates the culmination of yogic practice where the practitioner has gone beyond the dualities of pleasure and pain, attraction and aversion. The phrase 'na calati tattvataḥ' suggests that such a person remains firmly rooted in the ultimate reality, having transcended the fluctuations of the mind and senses.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the goal of dhyana yoga as presented in this chapter. It describes not merely a temporary meditative state but a permanent transformation of consciousness. The supreme bliss experienced is self-validating and self-sustaining, requiring no external support. This state represents the practical realization of the Self (Atman) and marks the transition from spiritual practice to spiritual attainment, where the yogi lives in constant awareness of the divine reality.",
