  "transliteration": "taṁ vidyād duḥkha-saṁyoga-viyogaṁ yoga-saṁjñitam |\nsa yogo niścayena yoktavyo nirviṇṇa-cetasā ||23||",
  "translation": "Let it be known that the severance of union with pain is called yoga. This yoga should be practiced with determination and with an undepressed, undiscouraged mind.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides a profound definition of yoga as the complete disconnection from suffering and pain. The term 'duḥkha-saṁyoga-viyoga' literally means the separation from the union with suffering, indicating that yoga is not merely a physical or mental practice, but a state of liberation from all forms of misery. This definition encompasses the ultimate goal of yoga practice—freedom from the dualities and sufferings inherent in material existence.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that this yoga must be practiced with 'niścaya' (determination and conviction) and with 'nirviṇṇa-cetasā' (an undepressed or undiscouraged mind). This instruction is particularly significant in the context of the chapter on meditation, as it acknowledges the challenges practitioners face. The path of yoga requires persistent effort without succumbing to frustration or disappointment when progress seems slow. The undiscouraged mind maintains enthusiasm and faith in the practice despite obstacles.\n\nThis verse serves as both a definition and an encouragement. It clarifies that the ultimate purpose of yoga is liberation from suffering, while simultaneously providing practical guidance on the mental attitude required for success. The emphasis on determination and cheerfulness reflects the realistic understanding that spiritual practice requires sustained effort over time, and that maintaining a positive, resolute attitude is essential for achieving the state of complete freedom from pain that yoga promises.",
