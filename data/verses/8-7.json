  "commentary": "This verse is one of the most practical and important teachings in the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna provides Arjuna with a direct instruction that combines spiritual practice with worldly duty. Krishna tells Arjuna to constantly remember Him while simultaneously performing his duty as a warrior. This teaching reconciles the apparent conflict between meditation and action, showing that spiritual remembrance need not be separate from one's dharmic responsibilities. The verse emphasizes that constant remembrance (anusmara) should be maintained at all times (sarveṣu kāleṣu), not just during formal meditation.\n\nThe second part of the verse reveals the method and the result. By offering both mind (manas) and intellect (buddhi) to the Divine, one creates a state of complete surrender and focus. The mind represents emotions and immediate thoughts, while the buddhi represents discriminative intelligence and decision-making capacity. When both are dedicated to Krishna, the practitioner achieves integration of their entire inner being. Krishna assures Arjuna with absolute certainty (asaṃśayaḥ) that this practice will lead to union with the Divine.\n\nThis verse establishes the principle of karma yoga combined with bhakti - performing one's duties while maintaining constant devotion and remembrance of God. It demonstrates that spiritual practice is not about abandoning responsibilities but about transforming one's consciousness while fulfilling them. This teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 8, which deals with the ultimate destination of the soul at death, showing that constant practice during life determines one's final state of consciousness.",
