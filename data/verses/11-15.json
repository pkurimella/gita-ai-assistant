  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\npaśyāmi devāṁs tava deva dehe sarvāṁs tathā bhūta-viśeṣa-saṅghān |\nbrahmāṇam īśaṁ kamalāsana-stham ṛṣīṁś ca sarvān uragāṁś ca divyān ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Lord, I see within Your body all the gods and various hosts of beings, Lord Brahma seated on the lotus, all the sages, and the celestial serpents.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks Arjuna's first response after receiving the divine vision of Krishna's universal form (Vishvarupa). Overwhelmed by what he witnesses, Arjuna begins to describe the cosmic manifestation he beholds. He sees all the devas (gods), diverse categories of beings, and the entire cosmic hierarchy contained within Krishna's form. This includes Brahma the creator seated on his lotus throne, all the great sages (rishis), and the divine serpents (celestial nagas).\n\nThe verse emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of Krishna's universal form - it is not merely vast in size, but contains within it the entire cosmic order and all levels of existence. Arjuna's vision reveals that everything that exists, from the highest gods to various categories of beings, all reside within the Supreme Being. This direct perception transforms Arjuna's understanding from intellectual knowledge to experiential realization of Krishna's true nature as the source and substratum of all existence.\n\nThis description sets the stage for the subsequent verses where Arjuna will continue to elaborate on the magnificent and terrifying aspects of the universal form. The mention of specific beings like Brahma and the sages indicates that Arjuna is witnessing not just an abstract cosmic principle, but the actual functioning divine hierarchy and the totality of creation in its living, dynamic reality.",
