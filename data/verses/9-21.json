  "sanskrit": "ते तं भुक्त्वा स्वर्गलोकं विशालं क्षीणे पुण्ये मर्त्यलोकं विशन्ति।\nएवं त्रयीधर्ममनुप्रपन्ना गतागतं कामकामा लभन्ते॥",
  "transliteration": "te taṁ bhuktvā svarga-lokaṁ viśālaṁ kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti |\nevaṁ trayī-dharmam anuprapannā gatāgataṁ kāma-kāmā labhante ||",
  "translation": "Having enjoyed the vast heavenly world, they return to the mortal world when their merit is exhausted. Thus, those who follow the rituals of the three Vedas, desiring sense pleasures, attain only the cycle of coming and going.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the limitation of karma-kāṇḍa (ritualistic worship) when performed with desire for material rewards. Krishna explains that those who worship the deities through Vedic rituals for the purpose of gaining heaven enjoy celestial pleasures temporarily, but once their accumulated merit (puṇya) is depleted, they must return to the mortal realm. This creates an endless cycle of birth and death (saṁsāra).\n\nThe phrase 'trayī-dharma' refers to the ritualistic portions of the three Vedas (Rig, Yajur, and Sama), which prescribe various ceremonies and sacrifices. While these practices are valid and part of Vedic tradition, Krishna points out their fundamental limitation: they cannot grant liberation (mokṣa) because they are rooted in desire and lead only to temporary results. The term 'gatāgatam' (coming and going) emphasizes the repetitive nature of this cycle.\n\nThis verse serves as a contrast to the path of devotion (bhakti) that Krishna has been describing throughout Chapter 9. While ritual worship yields temporary heavenly enjoyment, pure devotion to the Supreme leads to permanent liberation. Krishna is not condemning Vedic rituals but rather highlighting that desire-motivated worship, even when directed toward legitimate Vedic deities, keeps one bound to the material world. This teaching encourages seekers to transcend desire-based worship and embrace selfless devotion to attain the ultimate goal of union with the Divine.",
