  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the dietary preferences of those established in sattva guna (the mode of goodness). Such foods are characterized by their ability to enhance life span (āyuḥ), inner purity and clarity (sattva), physical strength (bala), freedom from disease (ārogya), happiness (sukha), and satisfaction (prīti). The specific qualities mentioned—juicy (rasyāḥ), unctuous or smooth (snigdhāḥ), substantial or nourishing (sthirā), and pleasing to the heart (hṛdyā)—indicate foods that are naturally wholesome, fresh, and prepared with care.\n\nThis verse is part of Krishna's larger teaching on the three types of faith and how they manifest in various aspects of life, including food preferences, worship, austerity, and charity. The sattvic diet is not merely about physical nourishment but reflects a consciousness that values purity, balance, and harmony. Such foods support spiritual practice by keeping the mind calm and clear, the body healthy and energetic, without creating excessive stimulation or dullness. This teaching emphasizes that spiritual development is holistic, encompassing not just meditation and study, but also practical aspects of daily life such as diet, which directly influence one's mental state and spiritual progress.",
