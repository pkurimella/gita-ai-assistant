  "translation": "Quickly he becomes righteous and attains eternal peace. O son of Kunti, proclaim it boldly that My devotee never perishes.",
  "commentary": "In this powerful verse, Krishna assures Arjuna that even a person who has committed grave sins can quickly become righteous (dharmātmā) through sincere devotion and attain lasting peace. The word 'kṣipram' (quickly) emphasizes that the transformation through bhakti is swift and effective, unlike other paths that may require prolonged effort over many lifetimes. This verse follows the previous one where Krishna declared that even the worst sinner who worships Him with exclusive devotion becomes righteous.\n\nKrishna's instruction to Arjuna to 'pratijānīhi' (proclaim boldly) is significant. He asks Arjuna to make this declaration on His behalf, perhaps to emphasize the certainty of this promise and to give Arjuna the role of spreading this liberating message. The phrase 'na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati' (My devotee never perishes) is one of the most reassuring statements in the entire Gita, providing absolute guarantee of protection and ultimate liberation to sincere devotees.\n\nThis verse encapsulates the essence of the bhakti-yoga taught in this chapter. It demonstrates Krishna's compassion and the supreme efficacy of devotion as a spiritual path. The 'śaśvat-śānti' (eternal peace) refers not just to temporary tranquility but to the permanent state of liberation (moksha). This teaching removes all fear and doubt from the aspirant's mind, encouraging even those who consider themselves unworthy to take refuge in divine grace.",
