  "transliteration": "tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā |\nupadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Learn that knowledge by humble prostration, by inquiry, and by service. The wise ones who have realized the Truth will impart knowledge unto you.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna outlines the proper approach for acquiring spiritual knowledge. He emphasizes three essential attitudes: praṇipāta (humble prostration or surrender), paripraśna (sincere inquiry and questioning), and sevā (selfless service to the teacher). This threefold approach demonstrates the disciple's readiness and worthiness to receive transcendental knowledge. Mere intellectual curiosity or arrogant questioning is insufficient; one must approach the guru with genuine humility and a spirit of service.\n\nKrishna specifies that such knowledge should be sought from jñāninas (the wise) who are tattva-darśinaḥ (seers of truth) - those who have direct realization of the ultimate reality, not merely theoretical understanding. These enlightened teachers, seeing the sincerity and readiness of the disciple, will naturally impart the knowledge of the Self. This verse establishes the guru-disciple tradition (guru-śiṣya paramparā) that is central to Vedantic teaching, emphasizing that self-realization requires guidance from one who has already traversed the path. The combination of humility, inquiry, and service creates the proper receptivity in the student for the transmission of spiritual wisdom.",
