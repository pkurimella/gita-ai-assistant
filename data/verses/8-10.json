  "translation": "At the time of death, with an unwavering mind, endowed with devotion and the power of yoga, fixing the life-force properly between the eyebrows, one attains that Supreme Divine Person.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the yogic technique for attaining the Supreme at the time of death. Krishna emphasizes three essential requirements: an unwavering mind (manasā acalena), devotion (bhakti), and yogic power (yoga-bala) developed through sustained practice. The verse specifically mentions the technique of fixing the prāṇa (life-force) between the eyebrows at the ājñā-cakra, a key practice in Kuṇḍalinī and Rāja Yoga systems.\n\nThe phrase 'prayāṇa-kāle' (at the time of departure) underscores the critical importance of one's final moment of consciousness. However, this ability to maintain perfect concentration at death is not spontaneous but results from lifelong practice and discipline. The 'yoga-bala' mentioned here refers to the strength acquired through regular meditation and breath control practices, which enables the yogi to consciously direct the life-force upward through the suṣumnā channel.\n\nThis verse connects to the broader theme of Chapter 8, which deals with the imperishable Brahman and the methods of attaining it. The 'paraṁ puruṣam divyam' (Supreme Divine Person) refers to the highest reality, which transcends both the manifest and unmanifest aspects of creation. The successful practice described here leads to liberation (mokṣa) and union with the Divine, representing the ultimate goal of yoga as taught throughout the Gita.",
