  "translation": "For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal and the immutable, of eternal dharma, and of absolute bliss.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 14 reveals Krishna's supreme position as the foundation of all existence. Krishna declares that He is the pratiṣṭhā (foundation or abode) of Brahman—the impersonal Absolute Reality. This statement establishes the relationship between the personal God (Saguna Brahman) and the impersonal Absolute (Nirguna Brahman), indicating that the personal aspect is the source and support of even the formless Brahman. He is the basis of immortality (amṛta), immutability (avyaya), eternal righteousness (śāśvata dharma), and supreme, unalloyed bliss (aikāntika sukha).\n\nThis verse provides the philosophical culmination to the chapter on the three gunas. Having explained how the gunas bind the soul and how one can transcend them, Krishna now reveals the ultimate reality that lies beyond the gunas—His own supreme nature. The verse establishes that transcending the gunas leads one to realize Krishna as the ultimate substratum of all existence. The four qualities mentioned—immortality, immutability, eternal dharma, and absolute bliss—represent the characteristics of the liberated state that one attains by going beyond the three gunas and taking refuge in the Supreme Lord. This verse bridges the discussion of gunas with the higher knowledge of devotion and surrender that will be elaborated in subsequent chapters.",
