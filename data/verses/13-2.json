  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nidaṁ śarīraṁ kaunteya kṣetram ity abhidhīyate |\netad yo vetti taṁ prāhuḥ kṣetrajña iti tadvidaḥ ||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: This body, O son of Kunti, is called the field (kshetra); one who knows this is called the knower of the field (kshetrajna) by those who know of them.",
  "commentary": "In this foundational verse of Chapter 13, Krishna introduces the central metaphor that structures the entire chapter: the distinction between kshetra (the field) and kshetrajna (the knower of the field). The body, along with all material nature, is compared to a field where experiences are cultivated and harvested. The conscious entity that observes and knows this field is the kshetrajna, the Self or soul. This distinction is fundamental to Vedantic philosophy and represents the dualism between matter (prakriti) and consciousness (purusha).\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Kaunteya' (son of Kunti), reminding him of his noble lineage while teaching this profound wisdom. The verse emphasizes that this knowledge is not Krishna's invention but is recognized by 'tadvidah' - those who know the truth, the wise seers and knowers of reality. This establishes the authority of the teaching within the broader Vedantic tradition. The verse sets up the detailed analysis that follows in subsequent verses, where Krishna will elaborate on the components of the field, the nature of the knower, and the means of discriminating between them.\n\nThis teaching is crucial for spiritual practice as it encourages the seeker to identify with the eternal knower (the Self) rather than with the temporary field (the body-mind complex). Understanding this distinction is the key to liberation, as it allows one to transcend identification with the changing material nature and realize one's true nature as pure consciousness.",
