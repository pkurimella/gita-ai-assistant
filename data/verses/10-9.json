  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics and inner life of His true devotees. Those whose consciousness (citta) is completely absorbed in the Divine and whose very life-force (prāṇa) is dedicated to Him live in a state of perpetual communion with the Supreme. These devotees form a spiritual community where they mutually enlighten each other (bodhayantaḥ parasparam), constantly engaging in discussions about the Lord's glories, teachings, and manifestations. This mutual sharing and spiritual discourse strengthens their devotion and deepens their understanding.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that such devotees find complete satisfaction (tuṣyanti) and joy (ramanti) in their devotional practices. Unlike worldly pleasures that are temporary and lead to satiation, the bliss derived from divine contemplation and discussion is ever-fresh and continuously fulfilling. This state represents the natural outcome of pure bhakti (devotion), where the devotee's entire existence revolves around the Divine. The use of 'nityam' (constantly) indicates that this is not an occasional practice but a continuous state of being, reflecting the complete transformation of consciousness that occurs in advanced devotees. This verse sets the stage for Krishna's promise in the next verse to grant such devotees the yoga of understanding by which they can reach Him.",
