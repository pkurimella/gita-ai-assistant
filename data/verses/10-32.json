  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna declares His all-encompassing presence in the temporal dimension of existence. He is the beginning (ādi), middle (madhya), and end (anta) of all created things, indicating that nothing exists independent of His divine presence. This statement emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality where the Supreme pervades all phases of manifestation - creation, preservation, and dissolution. This teaching aligns with the Vedantic principle that Brahman is both the material and efficient cause of the universe.\n\nKrishna then identifies Himself with adhyatma-vidya, the science of the Self or spiritual knowledge, declaring it supreme among all branches of learning. This is significant because while Krishna has been describing His manifestations in various worldly phenomena, He now points to the highest knowledge - that which leads to Self-realization. Among all forms of intellectual discourse and debate (vada), He represents the logical, reasoned argumentation that leads to truth, not mere sophistry or argumentation for its own sake. This verse thus elevates spiritual wisdom above all other forms of knowledge while acknowledging the value of proper reasoning in the pursuit of truth.",
