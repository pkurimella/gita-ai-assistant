  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes two distinct approaches to sensory sacrifice practiced by different yogis. The first group offers their senses—such as hearing and others—into the fires of self-restraint (samyama), meaning they practice strict control and withdrawal of the senses from their objects. These practitioners follow the path of sense-restraint, deliberately keeping their senses from engaging with external stimuli, similar to the practice of pratyahara in classical yoga.\n\nThe second group takes a different approach: they offer sense objects—sounds and other sensory experiences—into the fires of the senses themselves. This means they allow the senses to experience their objects but without attachment or desire, burning up the potential for bondage through awareness and detachment. Rather than suppressing sensory experience, they transform it through conscious, non-attached engagement. Both methods represent valid forms of yajna (sacrifice) on the spiritual path.\n\nThis verse illustrates the diversity of spiritual practices and acknowledges that different temperaments require different approaches. Some practitioners thrive through strict renunciation and sense-control, while others progress through mindful engagement with the world. Both paths, when practiced with proper understanding and discipline, lead to the same goal of self-realization and liberation from bondage.",
