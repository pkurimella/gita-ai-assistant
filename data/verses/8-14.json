  "translation": "For one who remembers Me constantly with undivided mind, who is ever united with Me in continuous meditation, O Partha, I am easy to attain for that ever-steadfast yogi.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents the essence of bhakti-yoga (devotional yoga) as the most accessible path to God-realization. Krishna declares that for those who practice constant remembrance (smaraṇa) with single-pointed devotion (ananya-cetāḥ), He becomes easily attainable (sulabha). The key qualification is 'ananya-cetāḥ' - having no other thought, meaning complete devotion without distraction by worldly desires or other goals. This is not occasional worship but continuous (satata, nityaśaḥ) remembrance that becomes the natural state of consciousness.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that such a devotee is 'nitya-yukta' - perpetually united or constantly engaged in yoga. This constant union is not merely intellectual contemplation but a living relationship of love and devotion. Krishna assures that for such a yogi, the Supreme is not distant or difficult to reach, but readily accessible. This teaching is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 8, which discusses the moment of death and the importance of one's final thoughts. For one who has cultivated constant remembrance throughout life, remembering the Divine at death becomes natural and effortless.\n\nThis verse also addresses the apparent difficulty of spiritual attainment discussed in earlier verses. While the path of knowledge and meditation may seem arduous, Krishna reveals that through pure devotion and constant remembrance, even the highest goal becomes 'sulabha' - easy to obtain. This democratizes spiritual realization, making it accessible not just to ascetics and scholars, but to anyone capable of sincere, unwavering devotion.",
