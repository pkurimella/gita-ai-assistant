  "translation": "Therefore, stationed in your respective positions at all the strategic points, let all of you guard Bhishma alone from all sides.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Duryodhana concludes his strategic instructions to his commanders. Having surveyed both armies and assessed the strengths and weaknesses, he now gives a crucial tactical directive. He commands all his warriors to remain firmly positioned at their assigned strategic points (ayana) and to specifically focus on protecting Bhishma, the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces. This reveals Duryodhana's anxiety despite his outward show of confidence in the previous verses.\n\nThe emphasis on protecting Bhishma indicates that Duryodhana recognizes that the grandsire is the pillar of his army's strength and morale. Despite having praised the adequacy of his forces, Duryodhana's concern for Bhishma's safety betrays his underlying insecurity. He understands that if Bhishma falls, the entire Kaurava army's confidence would collapse. This verse also subtly reveals Duryodhana's character - his dependence on others, his strategic thinking, and perhaps an unconscious awareness of the moral weakness of his position. The verse sets the stage for the actual commencement of battle and highlights the central role Bhishma will play in the war's early phase.",
