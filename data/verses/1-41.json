  "transliteration": "adharmābhibhavāt kṛṣṇa praduṣyanti kulastriyaḥ |\nstrīṣu duṣṭāsu vārṣṇeya jāyate varṇasaṅkaraḥ ||",
  "translation": "When irreligion prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted; and when women are corrupted, O descendant of Vrishni, there arises an unwanted progeny (intermixing of castes).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to express his concerns about the consequences of the impending war. He argues that when adharma (unrighteousness) dominates a family due to the destruction of its male protectors and elders, the women of noble families become vulnerable to corruption. This reflects the social context and concerns of ancient Indian society regarding family structure and social order.\n\nArjuna's argument follows a logical progression: war leads to the death of family elders, which leads to the breakdown of dharma, which in turn leads to the corruption of family values and the intermixing of varnas (social classes). He addresses Krishna with two epithets - 'Krishna' and 'Vārṣṇeya' (descendant of Vrishni) - showing both intimacy and respect. Arjuna believes that such social chaos would be worse than any political gain from victory in battle, revealing his deep concern for maintaining social and moral order. This verse demonstrates Arjuna's attempt to rationalize his reluctance to fight by projecting catastrophic social consequences.",
