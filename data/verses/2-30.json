  "translation": "The embodied soul dwelling in the body of everyone, O Bharata, is eternal and can never be slain. Therefore, you should not grieve for any living being.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna concludes his philosophical argument about the immortality of the soul that began in verse 11. He emphasizes that the dehī (the embodied soul or Self) residing in every body is eternal (nitya) and indestructible (avadhya). This universal truth applies not just to Arjuna's relatives on the battlefield, but to all living beings (sarvāṇi bhūtāni). The soul's indestructibility is an absolute reality that transcends individual circumstances.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Bhārata' (descendant of Bharata), reminding him of his noble lineage and the dharmic duty that comes with it. Since the soul cannot be killed and the body is temporary anyway, grief over the inevitable death of bodies is philosophically unjustified. This teaching forms the foundation of Vedantic wisdom - the discrimination between the eternal Self and the perishable body-mind complex.\n\nThis verse serves as a pivotal transition point in the chapter. Having established the metaphysical reality of the immortal soul through various arguments and analogies, Krishna now prepares to shift his discourse toward Arjuna's specific duty as a warrior (svadharma). The implication is clear: understanding the soul's immortality should liberate one from grief and enable right action in accordance with one's dharma.",
