  "translation": "Or he is born into a family of wise yogis. Indeed, such a birth as this is very difficult to obtain in this world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the second and more spiritually advantageous possibility for the fallen yogi's rebirth. While the previous verse described birth in a wealthy family, here Krishna speaks of an even rarer and more beneficial circumstance—being born into a family of enlightened yogis who possess both spiritual wisdom and yogic practice. Such families maintain traditions of meditation, self-discipline, and spiritual knowledge, providing an ideal environment for continuing one's spiritual journey.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that this type of birth is 'durlabhataram'—extremely rare and difficult to obtain in the world. This is because it requires significant spiritual merit accumulated over lifetimes. Being born among wise yogis (dhīmatām) means the individual will be surrounded by spiritual guidance, sacred teachings, and an atmosphere conducive to Self-realization from childhood itself. The family's collective wisdom and yogic practices create a powerful spiritual foundation that naturally propels the soul toward its ultimate goal. This verse reassures the aspirant that sincere spiritual effort is never wasted, and the soul's evolutionary journey continues in increasingly favorable circumstances until liberation is attained.",
