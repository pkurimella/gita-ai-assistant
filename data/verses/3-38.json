  "translation": "As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, and as an embryo is covered by the womb, so is knowledge covered by desire.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides three powerful analogies to illustrate how desire (kāma) obscures discriminative knowledge (jñāna). Just as smoke obscures fire, dust dims a mirror's reflection, and the womb conceals the embryo, desire veils the inherent wisdom of the soul. These three examples represent varying degrees of obscuration—smoke can be easily dispersed, dust requires more effort to clean, and the womb represents a complete covering that only time can remove. This gradation suggests that desire affects different individuals to different degrees based on their spiritual development.\n\nThis verse is central to Chapter 3's teaching on karma yoga because it explains why even wise individuals can fall prey to selfish action. The covering of knowledge by desire is not a permanent condition but a temporary obscuration of one's true discriminative faculty. Krishna uses these analogies to help Arjuna understand that the enemy he must conquer—desire—operates by clouding judgment and preventing one from seeing the true nature of the Self. The verse prepares the ground for the subsequent teaching on how to overcome this formidable foe through disciplined action and self-control, which are the hallmarks of karma yoga.",
