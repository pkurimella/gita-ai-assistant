  "sanskrit": "मा ते व्यथा मा च विमूढभावो दृष्ट्वा रूपं घोरमीदृङ्ममेदम् |\nव्यपेतभीः प्रीतमनाः पुनस्त्वं तदेव मे रूपमिदं प्रपश्य ||",
  "transliteration": "mā te vyathā mā ca vimūḍha-bhāvo dṛṣṭvā rūpaṁ ghoram īdṛṅ mama edam |\nvyapeta-bhīḥ prīta-manāḥ punas tvaṁ tad eva me rūpam idaṁ prapaśya ||",
  "translation": "Having seen this terrible form of Mine, be not afraid nor bewildered. With your fears dispelled and your heart gladdened, behold again this same form of Mine (the gentle four-armed form).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna compassionately addresses Arjuna's distress after witnessing the cosmic form (Viśvarūpa). Krishna recognizes that the overwhelming vision has caused fear and confusion in Arjuna, and He now seeks to comfort His devotee. The Lord instructs Arjuna to let go of his anxiety (vyathā) and bewilderment (vimūḍha-bhāva) that arose from seeing the terrible, awe-inspiring universal form.\n\nKrishna's words reveal the pedagogical purpose of the cosmic vision—it was meant to expand Arjuna's understanding of divinity, not to permanently terrify him. The Lord now promises to show His more familiar and pleasing four-armed form (chaturbhuja), which serves as an intermediate manifestation between the universal form and His human-like two-armed form as Arjuna's charioteer. This demonstrates Krishna's infinite compassion and His ability to manifest in forms appropriate to the capacity and need of the devotee.\n\nThis verse marks a crucial transition in Chapter 11, moving from the overwhelming theophany back to a more accessible divine manifestation. It illustrates an important spiritual principle: while the ultimate reality may be vast and terrifying in its totality, the Divine accommodates Itself to human limitations out of love. The progression from the universal form to gentler manifestations teaches that God reveals Himself according to the devotee's capacity to receive, emphasizing the personal, loving relationship between the Divine and the seeker.",
