  "sanskrit": "द्रुपदो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्वशः पृथिवीपते ।\nसौभद्रश्च महाबाहुः शङ्खान्दध्मुः पृथक्पृथक् ॥",
  "transliteration": "drupado draupadeyāś ca sarvaśaḥ pṛthivī-pate |\nsaubhadraś ca mahā-bāhuḥ śaṅkhān dadhmuḥ pṛthak pṛthak ||",
  "translation": "O King of the Earth, Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu), all blew their respective conches.",
  "commentary": "Sanjaya continues his vivid description of the Pandava army's response to the conch blowing initiated by Lord Krishna and Arjuna. This verse specifically mentions King Drupada, the father of Draupadi and a key ally of the Pandavas, along with the five sons of Draupadi (the Upapandavas), and Abhimanyu, the valiant son of Arjuna and Subhadra. The phrase 'pṛthak pṛthak' (separately, individually) emphasizes that each warrior blew his own conch, creating a tremendous collective sound that would have been both inspiring to the Pandava forces and demoralizing to their opponents.\n\nThe mention of these specific warriors is significant as it represents the younger generation of the Pandava side, symbolizing the continuity and future of dharma. Abhimanyu, described as 'mahā-bāhu' (mighty-armed), was particularly renowned for his valor despite his youth. This verse, along with the preceding ones, serves to build the atmosphere of the impending battle and demonstrates the formidable strength assembled on both sides. The detailed enumeration of warriors and their conch-blowing also serves a narrative purpose, allowing Dhritarashtra to visualize the scene and understand the magnitude of the forces arrayed against his sons, setting the stage for the moral and spiritual crisis that Arjuna will soon experience.",
