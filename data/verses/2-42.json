  "transliteration": "yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ pravadanty avipaścitaḥ |\nveda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha nānyad astīti vādinaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those who are unwise, O Partha, speak flowery words and delight in the letter of the Vedas, declaring that there is nothing else, saying 'this is all there is.'",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins a critique of those who misunderstand the true purpose of the Vedas. He describes people of limited understanding (avipaścitaḥ) who are attracted to the ornate, flowery language (puṣpitāṁ vācam) of Vedic rituals and their promised rewards. These individuals are attached to the ritualistic portions of the Vedas (karma-kāṇḍa) and believe that performing sacrifices for material gains represents the ultimate goal of spiritual life.\n\nKrishna characterizes such people as 'veda-vāda-ratāḥ' - those who delight in mere Vedic rhetoric without grasping the deeper philosophical truths. They proclaim 'nānyad asti' (there is nothing else), meaning they deny any reality beyond sensory pleasures and heavenly enjoyments attainable through rituals. This verse sets up Krishna's teaching that the Vedas have a higher purpose beyond ritualism - namely, the realization of the eternal Self and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThis critique is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 2, where Krishna is urging Arjuna to rise above attachment to results and embrace the wisdom of selfless action (karma yoga) and discriminative knowledge (jñāna). The verse warns against spiritual materialism - using religious practices merely for worldly gains rather than for self-realization and transcendence.",
