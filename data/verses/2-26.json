  "translation": "But even if you believe the soul to be perpetually born and perpetually dying, even then, O mighty-armed one, you should not grieve in this way.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents an alternative philosophical position to address Arjuna's grief. Having established the immortality of the soul in previous verses, Krishna now argues from the opposite standpoint—even if one accepts the materialistic view that the soul is repeatedly born and dies with each body, grief is still unjustified. This is a masterful rhetorical technique where Krishna covers all philosophical bases to eliminate Arjuna's sorrow.\n\nThe verse addresses those who might follow the Cārvāka or materialistic philosophy, which denies the eternal nature of the soul. Krishna argues that even from this perspective, death is a natural and inevitable process that has occurred countless times. If birth and death are constant, recurring phenomena in the natural order, then lamenting over what is inevitable and unavoidable is futile and unbecoming of a warrior.\n\nThis argument demonstrates Krishna's comprehensive approach to teaching. He doesn't merely present one philosophical view but addresses Arjuna's dilemma from multiple angles. Whether one accepts the Vedantic view of an eternal soul or a materialistic view of constant birth and death, the conclusion remains the same: grief over the inevitable is inappropriate. This verse reinforces the central teaching of Chapter 2—that a wise person must transcend emotional reactions based on temporary circumstances and act according to dharma.",
