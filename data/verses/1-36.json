  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection",
  "sanskrit": "पापमेवाश्रयेदस्मान्हत्वैतानाततायिनः।\nतस्मान्नार्हा वयं हन्तुं धार्तराष्ट्रान्स्वबान्धवान्।\nस्वजनं हि कथं हत्वा सुखिनः स्याम माधव॥",
  "transliteration": "pāpam evāśrayed asmān hatvaitān ātatāyinaḥ |\ntasmān nārhā vayaṃ hantuṃ dhārtarāṣṭrān svabandhavān |\nsva-janaṃ hi kathaṃ hatvā sukhinaḥ syāma mādhava ||",
  "translation": "Only sin will accrue to us by killing these aggressors. Therefore, it is not proper for us to slay the sons of Dhritarashtra, our own kinsmen. For how can we be happy, O Madhava (Krishna), after killing our own people?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna presents his moral argument against fighting in the war. Despite acknowledging that the Kauravas are ātatāyins (aggressors who deserve punishment according to dharma), he argues that killing them would still bring sin (pāpa) upon the Pandavas. He emphasizes the familial relationship by calling them 'svabandhavān' (our own kinsmen) and 'sva-janam' (our own people), suggesting that the bonds of kinship supersede political or legal considerations.\n\nArjuna's rhetorical question to Krishna—'how can we be happy after killing our own people?'—reveals his emotional turmoil and his belief that victory achieved through the death of relatives cannot bring genuine happiness or peace. He addresses Krishna as 'Mādhava,' invoking their intimate relationship and perhaps appealing to Krishna's compassionate nature. This verse exemplifies Arjuna's confusion between different levels of dharma: his duty as a warrior (kshatriya-dharma) versus his obligations to family. This confusion sets the stage for Krishna's teachings on the nature of duty, the eternal soul, and the path to liberation that will unfold in subsequent chapters.",
