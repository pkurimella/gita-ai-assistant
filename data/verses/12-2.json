  "transliteration": "śrī bhagavān uvāca\nmayy āveśya mano ye māṁ nitya-yuktā upāsate |\nśraddhayā parayopetās te me yuktatamā matāḥ ||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: Those who fix their minds on Me, ever steadfast in devotion, and worship Me with supreme faith—I consider them to be the most perfect in yoga.",
  "commentary": "In response to Arjuna's question about which path is superior—devotion to the personal form or meditation on the formless Absolute—Krishna unequivocally declares that those who worship Him with focused devotion are the most accomplished yogis. This verse establishes the supremacy of bhakti yoga (the path of devotion) over other spiritual practices. Krishna emphasizes three essential qualities of the ideal devotee: fixing the mind on Him (mayy āveśya manaḥ), constant practice (nitya-yuktā), and supreme faith (śraddhayā parayā).\n\nThe term 'yuktatamā' (most perfect in yoga) is significant here, as Krishna uses the superlative form to indicate that devotional worship represents the highest attainment in spiritual practice. This doesn't negate other paths but establishes a hierarchy where loving devotion to the personal aspect of the Divine is considered most accessible and effective for most practitioners. The emphasis on 'nitya-yuktā' (ever-steadfast) indicates that this devotion must be continuous and unwavering, not sporadic or conditional.\n\nThis verse sets the tone for the entire twelfth chapter, which elaborates on the qualities and practices of devotion. Krishna's response also provides comfort to those who find abstract meditation on the formless difficult, offering them a more tangible and emotionally fulfilling path through personal devotion. The requirement of 'supreme faith' (parayā śraddhayā) indicates that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient; the devotee must have complete trust and surrender to the Divine.",
