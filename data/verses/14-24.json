  "sanskrit": "समदुःखसुखः स्वस्थः समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः।\nतुल्यप्रियाप्रियो धीरस्तुल्यनिन्दात्मसंस्तुतिः॥",
  "transliteration": "sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ sva-sthaḥ sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ |\ntulya-priyāpriyo dhīras tulya-nindātma-saṁstutiḥ ||",
  "translation": "One who remains balanced in pleasure and pain, established in the Self, who views a clod of earth, a stone, and gold as equal, who is wise and remains the same toward the pleasant and unpleasant, and who is equipoised in praise and blame of oneself.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues the description of the characteristics of one who has transcended the three gunas. Such a person maintains perfect equanimity in all dualities of life—pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor. The phrase 'sva-sthaḥ' (established in the Self) indicates that this balance comes not from suppression or indifference, but from being firmly rooted in one's true nature beyond the modifications of the gunas. The comparison of viewing earth, stone, and gold equally demonstrates complete freedom from material attachment and the delusions created by rajas and tamas.\n\nThe quality of being 'dhīra' (wise or steady) shows that this equanimity is not mere stoicism but arises from profound spiritual wisdom. When one recognizes the Self as distinct from the body-mind complex and its experiences, external circumstances lose their power to disturb inner peace. Being equal in praise and blame indicates transcendence of ego-identification, as both praise and criticism pertain only to the limited personality, not to the eternal Self. This verse emphasizes that liberation is not about renouncing the world but about maintaining inner stability while engaging with it, seeing all material distinctions as ultimately insignificant compared to the reality of the Self.",
