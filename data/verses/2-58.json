  "translation": "When, like a tortoise withdrawing its limbs from all sides, one can completely withdraw the senses from their objects, then one's wisdom is firmly established.",
  "commentary": "This verse provides a powerful metaphor for sensory control, comparing the wise person to a tortoise that can retract its limbs into its shell at will. Just as a tortoise protects itself by withdrawing its vulnerable limbs, the person of steady wisdom (sthitaprajña) protects their consciousness by withdrawing the senses from external objects whenever necessary. This is not about permanent renunciation of the world, but rather about having complete mastery over one's senses—the ability to engage or disengage them consciously rather than being compelled by external stimuli.\n\nThis verse is part of Arjuna's question about the characteristics of a person of steady wisdom, which Krishna has been answering since verse 55. The tortoise analogy emphasizes voluntary control rather than forced suppression. The key is the word 'saṁharate' (withdraws), suggesting an active, conscious process. Unlike forced repression which creates internal conflict, this withdrawal is natural and effortless for one established in wisdom.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in establishing the foundation for all yogic practice: mastery over the senses (indriya-nigraha). This sensory withdrawal is not an end in itself but a means to turn consciousness inward toward Self-realization. When the senses are under control, the mind becomes stable, and only then can true discrimination and wisdom arise. This verse thus bridges the theoretical knowledge discussed earlier in the chapter with the practical discipline required for spiritual attainment.",
