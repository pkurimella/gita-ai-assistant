  "translation": "O Arjuna, that yogi is considered supreme who, through comparison with his own self, sees equality everywhere—whether in pleasure or in pain.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the highest standard of a true yogi—one who has developed complete empathy and equanimity through self-comparison. The phrase 'ātmaupamyena' (through comparison with one's own self) indicates that the yogi understands others' experiences by relating them to his own. Just as one naturally seeks pleasure and avoids pain for oneself, the supreme yogi recognizes this same tendency in all beings and treats everyone with equal compassion and understanding.\n\nThis verse represents the culmination of Krishna's teaching on dhyana yoga in this chapter. The supreme yogi is not merely one who has mastered meditation techniques or achieved personal tranquility, but one who has transcended the boundaries of individual consciousness to perceive the unity of all existence. Such a person sees no fundamental difference between self and others, experiencing others' joys and sorrows as their own. This universal empathy arises from the direct realization that the same Atman dwells in all beings.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this teaching lies in its integration of meditation practice with ethical living. Krishna emphasizes that true spiritual advancement is measured not by mystical experiences or supernatural powers, but by one's capacity for universal compassion and equanimity. This verse bridges the personal practice of yoga with its social and ethical dimensions, showing that the highest yoga is inseparable from seeing oneself in all beings and all beings in oneself.",
