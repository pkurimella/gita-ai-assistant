  "transliteration": "śarīraṁ yad avāpnoti yac cāpy utkrāmatīśvaraḥ |\ngṛhītvaitāni saṁyāti vāyur gandhān ivāśayāt ||",
  "translation": "When the lord (the embodied soul) acquires a body and when he leaves it, he takes these (the senses and mind) and goes, just as the wind carries fragrances from their source.",
  "commentary": "This verse beautifully illustrates the transmigration of the soul through a vivid metaphor. Krishna explains that when the individual soul (referred to here as 'īśvara' or lord of the body) enters a new body or departs from an old one at death, it carries with it the subtle body consisting of the mind, intellect, ego, and the sense impressions. The comparison to wind carrying fragrances is particularly apt—just as wind picks up scents from flowers and carries them elsewhere without being fundamentally changed, the soul carries its mental impressions and tendencies (vāsanās) from one body to another.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the Vedantic doctrine of reincarnation and karma. The 'īśvara' mentioned here should not be confused with the Supreme Lord, but rather refers to the jīvātman (individual soul) who is the master of its particular body. The subtle impressions, desires, and karmic tendencies accumulated through actions and thoughts form the basis for the next birth. This teaching emphasizes that our mental conditioning and accumulated impressions travel with us beyond physical death, determining the nature of our future existence. It underscores the importance of cultivating pure thoughts and righteous actions, as these subtle impressions shape our spiritual journey across lifetimes.",
