  "sanskrit": "अमी च त्वां धृतराष्ट्रस्य पुत्राः सर्वे सहैवावनिपालसङ्घैः ।\nभीष्मो द्रोणः सूतपुत्रस्तथासौ सहास्मदीयैरपि योधमुख्यैः ॥ २७ ॥",
  "transliteration": "amī ca tvāṁ dhṛtarāṣṭrasya putrāḥ sarve sahaivāvanipāla-saṅghaiḥ |\nbhīṣmo droṇaḥ sūta-putras tathāsau sahāsmadīyair api yodha-mukhyaiḥ || 27 ||",
  "translation": "All these sons of Dhritarashtra, along with hosts of kings, Bhishma, Drona, and Karna (the son of a charioteer), together with the chief warriors on our side as well, are rushing into Your fearful mouths.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his description of the terrifying cosmic vision, specifically identifying the warriors he recognizes entering Krishna's mouths. He sees all the sons of Dhritarashtra (the Kauravas), accompanied by numerous allied kings and rulers. Most significantly, he names the great warriors Bhishma (the grandsire), Drona (his teacher), and Karna (referred to as 'suta-putra' or son of a charioteer). Arjuna's observation that warriors from both sides—'our side as well' (asmadīyair api)—are rushing into the divine mouths reveals a profound truth: the Universal Form consumes all, making no distinction between friend and foe.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the impartiality of Time and Death, represented by Krishna's cosmic form. The vision strips away all worldly distinctions of alliance, loyalty, and enmity. Whether Kaurava or Pandava, all warriors are equally subject to the inexorable march of time and destiny. This realization is crucial for Arjuna's understanding that the outcome of the battle is already determined by cosmic forces beyond individual agency. The verse serves to demonstrate that Krishna, as the Supreme Reality, is the ultimate destroyer and that all beings are moving toward their predetermined end, regardless of which side they fight on.",
