  "commentary": "This verse is one of the most famous in the Bhagavad Gita, identifying the three primary gateways to spiritual destruction. Krishna declares that kama (lust/desire), krodha (anger), and lobha (greed) form a triad of vices that lead one toward naraka (hell) and the ruin of the soul. These three are not merely individual vices but interconnected forces that reinforce each other—unfulfilled desire leads to anger, and both are rooted in greed for sensory and material experiences. They represent the core demoniac qualities discussed throughout Chapter 16.\n\nThe metaphor of these three as 'gates' or 'doors' to hell is particularly significant. Just as one enters a house through a door, these vices serve as entry points into degraded consciousness and suffering. They destroy discrimination (viveka), cloud judgment, and lead one away from dharma. The verse emphasizes that these are destructive to the atman (soul/self) itself, not merely to external circumstances. When one is dominated by these forces, the higher spiritual nature is suppressed and the lower nature prevails.\n\nKrishna's prescription is direct and unambiguous: tyajet—abandon these three. This abandonment is not mere suppression but requires cultivation of opposite qualities—contentment over lust, forgiveness over anger, and generosity over greed. This verse serves as a practical summary of the demoniac qualities detailed earlier in the chapter and provides a clear focal point for spiritual practice. By guarding against these three gates, one protects oneself from the entire spectrum of demoniac tendencies and remains on the path toward divine qualities and ultimate liberation.",
