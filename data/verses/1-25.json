  "sanskrit": "भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम्।\nउवाच पार्थ पश्यैतान्समवेतान्कुरूनिति॥",
  "transliteration": "bhīṣma-droṇa-pramukhataḥ sarveṣāṁ ca mahī-kṣitām |\nuvāca pārtha paśyaitān samavetān kurūn iti ||",
  "translation": "In the presence of Bhishma, Drona, and all the rulers of the earth, Krishna said: \"O Partha (Arjuna), behold these Kurus assembled here.\"",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a pivotal moment where Krishna deliberately positions Arjuna's chariot between the two armies, specifically in front of the revered elders Bhishma and Drona. By addressing Arjuna as 'Partha' (son of Pritha/Kunti), Krishna reminds him of his royal lineage and warrior duty. The instruction to 'behold' (paśya) is significant—Krishna is not merely asking Arjuna to look, but to truly see and comprehend the situation before him. This sets the stage for Arjuna's emotional crisis that follows.\n\nThe strategic positioning before Bhishma and Drona is particularly significant because these are not ordinary warriors but Arjuna's own beloved teachers and grandsire. Krishna's deliberate choice to stop here, rather than anywhere else on the battlefield, serves a deeper purpose. It forces Arjuna to confront the full moral and emotional weight of the impending battle. This moment catalyzes Arjuna's inner conflict between duty (dharma) as a warrior and his natural human emotions of love and compassion for his kinsmen, which becomes the foundation for the entire Bhagavad Gita's teachings.",
