  "translation": "But those who worship the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the omnipresent, the unthinkable, the unchanging, the immovable, and the eternal—",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the path of those who worship the formless, attributeless Absolute (Nirguna Brahman). Krishna enumerates the characteristics of this supreme reality: it is akṣara (imperishable), anirdeśya (indefinable or indescribable), avyakta (unmanifest), sarvatra-ga (omnipresent), acintya (beyond thought), kūṭastha (unchanging like an anvil), acala (immovable), and dhruva (eternal). These terms emphasize the transcendent nature of the formless Absolute that is beyond sensory perception and mental conception.\n\nThis verse is incomplete and continues into the next verse (12.4), where Krishna describes the additional disciplines required for this path and ultimately declares that both paths lead to Him. The verse sets up an important comparison in the Bhakti Yoga chapter between the path of worshipping the manifest personal form (saguna upasana) versus the unmanifest formless reality (nirguna upasana). While both are valid spiritual paths, Krishna will go on to explain that the path of devotion to the personal form is easier for embodied beings to practice, as the mind naturally seeks something concrete to focus upon.",
