  "transliteration": "ye hi saṁsparśajā bhogā duḥkha-yonaya eva te |\nādyantavantaḥ kaunteya na teṣu ramate budhaḥ ||22||",
  "translation": "The pleasures born of sense contact are indeed sources of suffering, for they have a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti. The wise person does not delight in them.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound truth about the nature of sensory pleasures. He explains that all enjoyments arising from contact between the senses and their objects (saṁsparśajā bhogā) are inherently sources of suffering (duḥkha-yonaya). This is because they are temporary and finite (ādyantavantaḥ), having both a beginning and an end. The transient nature of sensory pleasures means they inevitably lead to dissatisfaction, craving, and pain when they cease or cannot be obtained.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Kaunteya' (son of Kunti), reminding him of his noble heritage and capacity for discrimination. The truly wise person (budhaḥ) who understands this fundamental truth does not seek happiness in these fleeting pleasures. Instead, such a person finds lasting joy in the eternal Self. This verse is central to the chapter's theme of karma-sannyasa, as it explains why the enlightened renounce attachment to the fruits of action—not out of aversion, but from clear understanding that sensory gratification cannot provide lasting fulfillment.\n\nThis teaching connects to the broader philosophy of the Gita by distinguishing between temporary worldly pleasures and eternal spiritual bliss (ānanda). It encourages practitioners to develop viveka (discrimination) and vairāgya (dispassion) toward sense objects, which are essential qualities for spiritual progress. The verse serves as a warning against becoming enslaved by sensory desires while pointing toward the superior happiness found in self-realization.",
