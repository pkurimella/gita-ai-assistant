  "sanskrit": "अमी च त्वां धृतराष्ट्रस्य पुत्राः सर्वे सहैवावनिपालसङ्घैः ।\nभीष्मो द्रोणः सूतपुत्रस्तथासौ सहास्मदीयैरपि योधमुख्यैः ॥",
  "transliteration": "amī ca tvāṁ dhṛtarāṣṭrasya putrāḥ sarve sahaivāvanipāla-saṅghaiḥ |\nbhīṣmo droṇaḥ sūta-putras tathāsau sahāsmadīyair api yodha-mukhyaiḥ ||",
  "translation": "All these sons of Dhritarashtra, along with hosts of kings, Bhishma, Drona, and Karna the son of a charioteer, together with the chief warriors on our side as well—",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his description of the terrifying cosmic vision, now identifying specific warriors he sees entering Krishna's universal form. He observes all the sons of Dhritarashtra (the hundred Kauravas), accompanied by numerous allied kings and rulers. Most significantly, he sees the great warriors Bhishma (the grandsire), Drona (his teacher), and Karna (referred to as 'suta-putra' or son of a charioteer), all moving toward their inevitable destruction.\n\nWhat makes this vision particularly poignant is Arjuna's observation that warriors from both sides—not just the enemy Kauravas but also 'our chief warriors' (asmadīyair api yodha-mukhyaiḥ)—are being drawn into the cosmic form. This reveals the impartial nature of time and death, showing that the outcome of the battle is already determined in the divine plan. The verse emphasizes the futility of Arjuna's earlier concerns about killing his relatives and teachers, as their fate is already sealed in the cosmic order.\n\nThis verse serves as a crucial turning point in Arjuna's understanding, preparing him to accept his role as an instrument of divine will rather than the ultimate cause of these deaths. The vision demonstrates that Krishna, as Time itself (Kāla), has already destroyed these warriors, and Arjuna is merely to be the apparent instrument in the divine plan.",
