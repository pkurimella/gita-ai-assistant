  "translation": "Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives for perfection; and of those who strive and succeed, scarcely one knows Me in truth.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the rarity of true spiritual knowledge. He establishes a hierarchy of spiritual aspiration and achievement: among thousands of human beings, only a rare few actually make sincere effort toward self-realization (siddhaye). Even among those who strive earnestly, only a handful achieve perfection or success in their spiritual practices. And among even these accomplished souls (siddhānāṁ), only an exceptional few come to know Krishna in His true essence (tattvataḥ).\n\nThis verse serves as both a sobering reality check and an encouragement. Krishna is not discouraging Arjuna but rather emphasizing the precious value of the knowledge He is about to impart. The path to knowing the Divine in truth requires more than casual interest or superficial practice—it demands dedicated effort, sustained practice, and divine grace. The word 'tattvataḥ' (in truth/in essence) is crucial here, indicating that many may have some knowledge of God, but very few penetrate to the ultimate reality of the Divine nature. This sets the stage for the profound teachings on divine nature that follow in Chapter 7, where Krishna will reveal both His lower material nature (prakṛti) and His higher spiritual nature (parā prakṛti).",
