  "sanskrit": "किं पुनर्ब्राह्मणाः पुण्या भक्ता राजर्षयस्तथा ।\nअनित्यमसुखं लोकमिमं प्राप्य भजस्व माम् ॥३३॥",
  "transliteration": "kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayas tathā |\nanityam asukhaṁ lokam imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām ||33||",
  "translation": "How much more easily then do the holy brahmanas and devoted royal sages attain Me! Having come to this impermanent and joyless world, devote yourself to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna employs a logical argument known as 'a fortiori' reasoning. After stating in the previous verse that even those of lower birth can attain the supreme goal through devotion, He now emphasizes that righteous brahmanas and royal sages (rājarṣis) can certainly achieve this with even greater ease. This is not a statement of spiritual hierarchy but rather a rhetorical device to encourage Arjuna, who belongs to the royal class, by showing that the path is especially accessible to those who combine worldly responsibility with spiritual dedication.\n\nThe second half of the verse contains a profound teaching about the nature of worldly existence. Krishna characterizes this world as 'anitya' (impermanent) and 'asukha' (joyless or full of suffering). This is not pessimism but realism—an acknowledgment of the transient nature of material existence and its inability to provide lasting happiness. Given this reality, Krishna urges Arjuna to direct his devotion toward the eternal and blissful Supreme. The phrase 'bhajasva mām' (devote yourself to Me) is a direct, personal call to bhakti.\n\nThis verse serves as a pivotal transition in Chapter 9, moving from the universal accessibility of devotion to a personal exhortation. It encapsulates the central message of the chapter: that in a world characterized by impermanence and suffering, the most rational and fulfilling course of action is to cultivate devotion to the Divine. The verse bridges philosophical understanding with practical application, urging immediate action rather than mere intellectual appreciation of spiritual truths.",
