  "sanskrit": "कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि।\nयोगिनः कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वात्मशुद्धये॥",
  "transliteration": "kāyena manasā buddhyā kevalair indriyair api |\nyoginaḥ karma kurvanti saṅgaṃ tyaktvātma-śuddhaye ||",
  "translation": "The yogis perform action with the body, mind, intellect, and even with the senses alone, abandoning attachment, for the purification of the self.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the practical methodology of Karma Yoga as taught by Krishna. The yogi engages in action using all instruments available—the physical body, the mind, the intellect, and the senses—but does so without any sense of personal attachment or desire for results. The key phrase 'saṅgaṃ tyaktvā' (abandoning attachment) indicates that the renunciation is not of action itself but of the ego-driven identification with action and its fruits. The word 'kevalaiḥ' (alone/merely) emphasizes that these instruments are used as pure tools without the contamination of personal desire.\n\nThe purpose stated here is 'ātma-śuddhaye'—purification of the self. This reveals that Karma Yoga is not merely a technique for worldly efficiency but a spiritual discipline aimed at inner purification. By performing actions without attachment, the practitioner gradually removes the impurities of ego, desire, and identification that cloud the true nature of the Self. This verse fits perfectly within Chapter 5's theme of reconciling action and renunciation, showing that true renunciation occurs in the attitude toward action rather than in the abandonment of action itself. The yogi remains fully engaged in the world while maintaining inner detachment, thus achieving both practical effectiveness and spiritual progress.",
