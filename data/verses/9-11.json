  "transliteration": "avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam |\nparaṁ bhāvam ajānanto mama bhūta-maheśvaram ||11||",
  "translation": "Fools disregard Me when I assume a human form, not knowing My supreme nature as the Great Lord of all beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a fundamental problem in spiritual understanding: the inability of the ignorant to recognize the Divine when it manifests in human form. The foolish (mūḍhā) see only the external physical form and fail to perceive the transcendent reality that dwells within. They judge by appearances alone and thus miss the profound truth of the Divine incarnation. This verse explains why many people, even when in the presence of an avatar or divine manifestation, fail to recognize or honor that presence.\n\nKrishna identifies Himself as the 'bhūta-maheśvaram'—the Great Lord of all beings. This declaration emphasizes that despite taking on a human body, His essential nature remains supreme and unchanged. The verse highlights a key teaching of the Gita: the Divine can descend into material form without being limited by it. Those who are deluded by external appearances (māyā) cannot penetrate beyond the surface to recognize the infinite consciousness that has assumed finite form for the welfare of humanity.\n\nThis verse is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 9's theme of royal knowledge. Understanding the true nature of Divine incarnation requires wisdom that transcends ordinary perception. It calls for faith, devotion, and the ability to see beyond the material covering to the spiritual essence. This teaching also serves as a warning against judging spiritual teachers and divine manifestations merely by their external appearance or human characteristics.",
