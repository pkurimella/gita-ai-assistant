  "sanskrit": "तत्रैकस्थं जगत्कृत्स्नं प्रविभक्तमनेकधा।\nअपश्यद्देवदेवस्य शरीरे पाण्डवस्तदा॥",
  "transliteration": "tatraikasthaṁ jagat kṛtsnaṁ pravibhaktam anekadhā |\napaśyad devadevasya śarīre pāṇḍavas tadā ||",
  "translation": "There, in the body of the God of gods, Arjuna then saw the entire universe, with its manifold divisions, all gathered together in one place.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the extraordinary vision that Arjuna beholds after Krishna grants him divine sight. Arjuna witnesses the entire cosmos—all worlds, beings, and phenomena—unified yet simultaneously differentiated within Krishna's universal form. The phrase 'ekastham' (established in one place) combined with 'pravibhaktam anekadhā' (divided in many ways) captures the paradoxical nature of this vision: the simultaneous unity and diversity of all existence.\n\nThis vision represents a pivotal moment in the Gita, as Arjuna directly perceives the ultimate reality that Krishna has been teaching throughout the previous chapters. The universal form (Viśvarūpa) reveals that all apparent multiplicity in the universe exists within the one Supreme Being. Every creature, every world, every element of creation is shown to be both distinct and yet part of the singular divine reality. This experiential knowledge transcends intellectual understanding and provides Arjuna with direct perception of Krishna's true nature as the source and substratum of all existence.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this vision is of the 'devadeva' (God of gods), indicating Krishna's supreme position above all other divine beings. This cosmic revelation serves to prepare Arjuna for the more terrifying aspects of the universal form that follow, while also establishing the philosophical foundation that all diversity emerges from and exists within the one ultimate reality.",
