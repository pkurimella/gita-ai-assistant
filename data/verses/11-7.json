  "transliteration": "ihaika-sthaṁ jagat kṛtsnaṁ paśyādya sa-carācaram|\nmama dehe guḍākeśa yac cānyad draṣṭum icchasi||",
  "translation": "Behold now, O Arjuna, in this body of Mine, the entire universe centered in one place—including all moving and non-moving beings—and whatever else you desire to see.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna invites Arjuna to witness the complete cosmic manifestation within His divine form. The phrase 'ihaika-stham' (centered in one place) indicates that the entire universe with all its diversity, including both the animate (carā) and inanimate (acarā) creation, exists simultaneously within Krishna's universal body. This is a profound revelation that transcends ordinary perception, showing that all of existence is contained within the Divine.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Gudakesha' (conqueror of sleep), perhaps to emphasize that Arjuna must be fully alert and conscious to comprehend this extraordinary vision. The Lord is not merely showing a physical form but revealing the metaphysical truth that all manifestation, past, present, and future, exists within Him. This verse sets the stage for the actual revelation of the Vishvarupa (universal form) that follows, preparing Arjuna for an experience that will fundamentally transform his understanding of reality.\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in its demonstration of divine immanence—that God is not separate from creation but contains all of creation within Himself. This vision will reveal the ultimate non-dual reality where the Divine and the cosmos are not separate entities but one unified whole. Krishna's invitation 'whatever else you desire to see' indicates the completeness of this revelation, encompassing all dimensions of existence, including those beyond normal human comprehension.",
