  "sanskrit": "अभिसन्धाय तु फलं दम्भार्थमपि चैव यत् ।\nइज्यते भरतश्रेष्ठ तं यज्ञं विद्धि राजसम् ॥१२॥",
  "transliteration": "abhisandhāya tu phalaṁ dambhārtham api caiva yat |\nijyate bharataśreṣṭha taṁ yajñaṁ viddhi rājasam ||12||",
  "translation": "But that sacrifice which is performed with a view to its fruits, and also for the sake of ostentation, O best of the Bharatas, know that to be rajasic (born of passion).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of rajasic sacrifice, which stands in contrast to the sattvic sacrifice described in the previous verse. A rajasic sacrifice is performed with two primary motivations: the desire for specific results (abhisandhāya phalam) and the desire for show or ostentation (dambhārtham). Such sacrifices are performed by those who seek personal gain, recognition, or social prestige rather than spiritual advancement or selfless offering to the Divine.\n\nThe rajasic performer of sacrifice is driven by passion and attachment to outcomes. They may perform elaborate rituals to gain wealth, power, social status, or heavenly rewards. Additionally, they may conduct these ceremonies with great pomp and display to impress others and gain admiration. This attitude transforms what should be a sacred act into a transaction or a performance for worldly benefit. The emphasis on external show and material results indicates the dominance of rajas (passion and activity) in the performer's nature.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 17's exploration of the three types of faith and their manifestations in various practices. Krishna systematically categorizes different approaches to spiritual practices based on the three gunas, helping Arjuna understand that the quality of one's actions is determined not just by the external form but by the internal motivation and consciousness with which they are performed. This verse serves as a warning against performing spiritual practices with egoistic or materialistic motives.",
