  "transliteration": "moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ | rākṣasīm āsurīṁ caiva prakṛtiṁ mohinīṁ śritāḥ ||12||",
  "translation": "Those of futile hopes, futile actions, and futile knowledge, devoid of discrimination, take refuge in the delusive nature of demons and asuras (those with demoniacal and atheistic tendencies).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes those who fail to recognize His divine nature and instead pursue materialistic and atheistic paths. He characterizes such people as having three types of futility: futile hopes (moghāśā), futile actions (mogha-karmāṇa), and futile knowledge (mogha-jñāna). Their hopes are futile because they seek temporary, material gains rather than eternal spiritual fulfillment. Their actions are futile because they are not directed toward the Supreme and thus bind them further in the cycle of karma. Their knowledge is futile because it lacks true discrimination and understanding of the ultimate reality.\n\nThese individuals are described as vicetasaḥ—devoid of proper discrimination or understanding. They have adopted a rākṣasī (demoniac) and āsurī (atheistic) nature, which is mohinī (delusive). This delusive nature causes them to reject divine principles and pursue selfish, materialistic goals. Such people may appear successful in worldly terms, but their achievements are ultimately hollow because they lack spiritual foundation. This verse serves as a warning against adopting materialistic and atheistic worldviews that deny the divine nature of existence and the Supreme Lord. It contrasts sharply with the mahātmās described in the previous verse, who recognize Krishna's divine nature and worship Him with devotion.",
