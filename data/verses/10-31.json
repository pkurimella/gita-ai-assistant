  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations across various categories of existence. He identifies Himself with the wind (pavana) among all purifying agents, as wind purifies the atmosphere and is essential for life. Among warriors who bear weapons, He is Rama—the ideal king and hero of the Ramayana, who represents dharma, righteousness, and the perfect balance of power with virtue. This reference to Rama is significant as it connects Krishna to another avatar of Vishnu, emphasizing the continuity of divine manifestation.\n\nKrishna then identifies with the makara (often translated as shark or crocodile) among aquatic creatures, representing strength and dominance in the waters. Finally, among rivers, He is the Jahnavi or Ganges, the most sacred river in Hindu tradition. The Ganges is not merely a physical river but represents spiritual purification, liberation, and the descent of divine grace to earth. Each of these manifestations represents the supreme excellence in its category—the wind's purifying power, Rama's righteous strength, the shark's aquatic supremacy, and the Ganges' spiritual sanctity. Through these examples, Krishna teaches that the divine can be recognized in whatever is most excellent, pure, and powerful in creation, encouraging devotees to see the sacred in the natural world and in exemplary beings.",
