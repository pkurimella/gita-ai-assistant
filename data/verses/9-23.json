  "transliteration": "ye 'py anya-devatā-bhaktā yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ |\nte 'pi mām eva kaunteya yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam ||",
  "translation": "Those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other deities, they too worship Me alone, O son of Kunti, but in an improper manner.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound truth about the nature of worship and devotion. He explains that even those who worship other deities with sincere faith are ultimately worshipping Him, though they do so unknowingly and not according to the proper method (avidhi-pūrvakam). This statement reflects the non-dualistic understanding that all divine forms are manifestations of the one Supreme Reality. However, Krishna makes an important distinction: such worship is 'avidhi-pūrvakam' - not in accordance with the prescribed method or scriptural injunctions.\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in Krishna's compassionate acknowledgment that all sincere worship reaches Him, while simultaneously pointing out that there is a more direct and effective path. Those who worship other deities may receive temporary benefits and eventually reach Krishna, but their path is indirect and their understanding incomplete. The proper method (vidhi-pūrvakam) would be to worship the Supreme directly with full knowledge of His true nature as the ultimate source of all divine manifestations. This verse thus balances inclusivity with the teaching that direct devotion to the Supreme, with proper understanding, is the highest form of worship.",
