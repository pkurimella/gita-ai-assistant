  "transliteration": "saṅkalpa-prabhavān kāmāṁs tyaktvā sarvān aśeṣataḥ |\nmanasaivendriya-grāmaṁ viniyamya samantataḥ ||24||",
  "translation": "Abandoning completely all desires born of mental imagination, and restraining the entire group of senses from all sides by the mind alone.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides practical instruction on the mental discipline required for meditation. He emphasizes that the aspirant must completely abandon all desires that arise from saṅkalpa (mental imagination or conceptualization). These desires are not merely external wants but include all the subtle mental projections and fantasies that disturb the mind's equilibrium. The word 'aśeṣataḥ' (completely, without remainder) indicates that partial renunciation is insufficient—one must be thorough in this practice.\n\nThe second part of the verse addresses the control of the senses (indriya-grāma, literally 'the group of senses'). Krishna instructs that this control must be exercised 'samantataḥ' (from all sides, completely), meaning the practitioner must be vigilant in all directions, not allowing the senses to wander toward their respective objects. Importantly, this restraint is to be accomplished by the mind (manasā eva) alone, not through external force or suppression. This indicates the supremacy of mental discipline in yoga practice.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the practical methodology of dhyāna-yoga. It bridges the gap between the philosophical understanding of yoga and its actual practice. The verse teaches that true meditation requires both the negative discipline of abandoning desires and the positive discipline of sense-control, both accomplished through trained mental awareness rather than mere physical austerity.",
