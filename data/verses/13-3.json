  "sanskrit": "तत्क्षेत्रं यच्च यादृक्च यद्विकारि यतश्च यत् ।\nस च यो यत्प्रभावश्च तत्समासेन मे शृणु ॥३॥",
  "transliteration": "tat kṣetraṁ yac ca yādṛk ca yad-vikāri yataś ca yat |\nsa ca yo yat-prabhāvaś ca tat samāsena me śṛṇu ||3||",
  "translation": "What that Field is, of what nature, what its modifications are, from what causes what effects arise, and who the Knower is, and what His powers are—hear all this briefly from Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna announces His intention to systematically explain the nature of both the Field (kṣetra) and the Knower of the Field (kṣetrajña). He outlines the topics He will cover: the essential nature of the Field, its characteristics and qualities, the modifications or changes it undergoes, the causal relationships within it, the identity of the Knower, and the powers or capacities of that Knower. The word 'samāsena' (briefly or in summary) indicates that Krishna will provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of these profound metaphysical concepts.\n\nThis verse serves as a roadmap for the entire chapter, establishing the framework for understanding the dualistic relationship between matter and consciousness, body and soul, the known and the knower. Krishna's promise to explain these concepts 'briefly' suggests that while the subject is vast and complex, He will distill the essential truths in a manner accessible to sincere seekers. This systematic approach reflects the pedagogical method of the Gita, where complex philosophical concepts are presented in an organized, digestible manner. The verse prepares Arjuna (and the reader) for the detailed analysis that follows in subsequent verses.",
