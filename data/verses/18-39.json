  "transliteration": "yad agre cānubandhe ca sukhaṁ mohanam ātmanaḥ |\nnidrālasya-pramādotthaṁ tat tāmasam udāhṛtam ||",
  "translation": "That happiness which deludes the self from beginning to end, arising from sleep, laziness, and negligence—that is declared to be tamasic (born of ignorance).",
  "commentary": "This verse completes Krishna's classification of the three types of happiness by describing tamasic happiness, which is the lowest and most deluded form. Unlike sattvic happiness that begins as poison but ends as nectar, and rajasic happiness that begins as nectar but ends as poison, tamasic happiness is characterized by delusion both at the beginning (agre) and in its continuation (anubandhe). This type of happiness does not lead to any real fulfillment or growth but keeps the individual trapped in ignorance.\n\nThe verse identifies three primary sources of tamasic happiness: nidra (excessive sleep), alasya (laziness or sloth), and pramada (heedlessness or negligence). These qualities represent a complete absence of spiritual aspiration and self-effort. Such happiness is fundamentally self-deceptive (mohanam atmanah), as it creates an illusion of contentment while actually degrading consciousness and preventing any possibility of self-realization. This type of happiness binds one to the lowest mode of material nature and perpetuates the cycle of ignorance and suffering.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18's teaching on renunciation and liberation, this verse serves as a warning against the path of tamas. While Krishna has encouraged Arjuna to perform his duty, he makes clear that action performed in a state of delusion, lethargy, or carelessness leads nowhere. The spiritual aspirant must transcend tamasic tendencies to progress on the path. This classification helps practitioners honestly assess their motivations and the quality of their experiences, enabling them to consciously choose actions and attitudes that elevate rather than degrade consciousness.",
