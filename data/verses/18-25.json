  "sanskrit": "अनुबन्धं क्षयं हिंसामनपेक्ष्य च पौरुषम् ।\nमोहादारभ्यते कर्म यत्तत्तामसमुच्यते ॥२५॥",
  "transliteration": "anubandhaṁ kṣayaṁ hiṁsām anapekṣya ca pauruṣam |\nmohād ārabhyate karma yat tat tāmasam ucyate ||25||",
  "translation": "That action which is undertaken through delusion, without regard for consequences, loss, injury to others, or one's own capacity—such action is declared to be tamasic (born of ignorance).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of tamasic (ignorant) action, completing his threefold classification of karma according to the three gunas. Tamasic action is initiated from moha (delusion) and is characterized by a complete disregard for its consequences (anubandha), the destruction or loss it may cause (kṣaya), the harm it inflicts on others (hiṁsā), and whether one even has the capacity to perform it (pauruṣa). Such action is impulsive, reckless, and driven by ignorance of dharma and reality.\n\nThis type of action stands in stark contrast to sattvic action (performed as duty without attachment) and rajasic action (performed with ego and desire for results). Tamasic action is the most degraded form of karma as it arises from complete spiritual darkness. The person performing such action is oblivious to moral principles, ethical considerations, and practical wisdom. They act without thinking about whether the action will harm themselves or others, whether they have the ability to complete it, or what the ultimate outcome will be. This verse serves as a warning against acting from a state of delusion and emphasizes the importance of discrimination and awareness in all our undertakings.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18's comprehensive teaching on moksha through renunciation, this verse helps Arjuna understand what types of actions must be transcended or avoided on the spiritual path. By recognizing tamasic qualities in action, a seeker can consciously elevate their conduct toward sattvic action, which ultimately leads to liberation.",
