  "translation": "Among the Vedas I am the Sama Veda; among the gods I am Indra (Vasava); among the senses I am the mind; and among living beings I am consciousness.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations by identifying Himself with the most excellent among various categories. He declares Himself to be the Sama Veda among the Vedas, which is considered the most melodious and is primarily used in ritualistic worship through sacred chants. Among the gods (devas), He is Vasava or Indra, the king of the celestial beings who represents power and sovereignty. These identifications show that Krishna manifests as the supreme or most prominent in each category.\n\nThe second half of the verse moves from external manifestations to internal faculties. Among the senses (indriyas), Krishna identifies as the mind (manas), which is considered the coordinating principle that governs all sensory and motor organs. The mind is superior to the individual senses as it processes, integrates, and directs sensory information. Finally, among all living beings (bhūtas), He is consciousness (cetanā) itself—the fundamental principle of awareness that distinguishes the living from the non-living. This progression from the gross to the subtle demonstrates that Krishna's presence is most evident in the refined, coordinating, and conscious aspects of existence, ultimately pointing to the supreme consciousness that underlies all manifestation.",
