  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: One who performs his prescribed duty without depending on the fruits of action—he is a true renunciant and a true yogi, not one who merely abstains from fire rituals or physical activities.",
  "commentary": "This opening verse of the sixth chapter establishes a crucial principle that bridges the concepts of karma yoga and sannyasa (renunciation). Krishna clarifies a common misconception about what constitutes true renunciation. He declares that a genuine sannyasi or yogi is not defined by external renunciation of rituals or cessation of activities, but rather by the internal attitude of performing one's duties without attachment to results. This verse directly addresses Arjuna's confusion from earlier chapters about whether the path of action or renunciation is superior.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that true renunciation lies in the renunciation of desire for fruits (karma-phala), not in the abandonment of action itself. The person who works without depending on outcomes embodies both sannyasa (renunciation) and yoga (union with the Divine) simultaneously. This teaching refutes the notion that one must abandon worldly duties to achieve spiritual progress. Instead, it presents the ideal of nishkama karma—selfless action performed as an offering to the Divine, which becomes a powerful spiritual practice in itself. This sets the foundation for the meditation practices that will be elaborated upon in the rest of this chapter.",
