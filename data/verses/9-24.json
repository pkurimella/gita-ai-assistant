  "sanskrit": "अहं हि सर्वयज्ञानां भोक्ता च प्रभुरेव च।\nन तु मामभिजानन्ति तत्त्वेनातश्च्यवन्ति ते॥",
  "transliteration": "ahaṁ hi sarva-yajñānāṁ bhoktā ca prabhur eva ca |\nna tu mām abhijānanti tattvenātaś cyavanti te ||",
  "translation": "I alone am the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices. But those who do not recognize Me in truth, they fall back into the mortal world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound truth about the ultimate recipient of all worship and sacrifice. He declares that He is both the enjoyer (bhoktā) and the supreme Lord (prabhu) of all sacrificial offerings, regardless of which deity they are ostensibly directed toward. This statement emphasizes the non-dual nature of divinity - that all forms of worship ultimately reach the Supreme Being, even when devotees worship various deities.\n\nThe second half of the verse addresses the consequence of ignorance regarding this truth. Those who perform sacrifices and worship various deities without understanding that Krishna (the Supreme Reality) is the ultimate recipient do not attain permanent liberation. Instead, they 'fall back' (cyavanti) into the cycle of birth and death. This is because worship performed with limited understanding yields limited, temporary results - such as elevation to heavenly realms - but not moksha (liberation). The key distinction is between worship performed with complete knowledge (tattva-jñāna) versus worship performed with partial or sectarian understanding.\n\nThis verse is central to the chapter's theme of revealing the supreme secret knowledge. It establishes the philosophical foundation that while various paths and deities may be worshipped, true liberation comes only from recognizing the ultimate unity of all divine manifestations in the Supreme Person. This understanding transforms ritualistic worship into genuine devotion directed toward the Absolute Truth.",
