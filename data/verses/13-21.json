  "transliteration": "kārya-karaṇa-kartṛtve hetuḥ prakṛtir ucyate |\npuruṣaḥ sukha-duḥkhānāṁ bhoktṛtve hetur ucyate ||21||",
  "translation": "Prakriti (Nature) is said to be the cause of effect, instrument, and agency, while Purusha (the individual soul) is said to be the cause in the experience of pleasure and pain.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes the fundamental distinction between Prakriti and Purusha in the process of creation and experience. Krishna explains that Prakriti (material nature) is responsible for the production of effects (kārya), the instruments or organs of action and perception (karaṇa), and the sense of doership or agency (kartṛtva). All physical manifestations, the body, senses, and the ego-sense that claims 'I am the doer' arise from Prakriti. This includes the entire mechanism of action in the material world.\n\nHowever, the Purusha (the conscious principle or individual soul) is declared to be the cause of the experience of pleasure and pain. While Prakriti provides the apparatus and mechanism, it is the Purusha's association with Prakriti that enables the actual experience of sensations. The soul, when identified with the body-mind complex, becomes the experiencer (bhoktṛ) of the fruits of actions. This verse is crucial in understanding the bondage of the soul - Prakriti creates the conditions and instruments, but it is the Purusha's identification with these that leads to the experience of duality, pleasure and pain, and the cycle of birth and death. Liberation comes from understanding this distinction and realizing one's true nature as separate from Prakriti.",
