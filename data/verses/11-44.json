  "transliteration": "tasmāt praṇamya praṇidhāya kāyaṁ prasādaye tvām aham īśam īḍyam |\npiteva putrasya sakheva sakhyuḥ priyaḥ priyāyārhasi deva soḍhum ||",
  "translation": "Therefore, bowing down and prostrating my body, I seek Your grace, O adorable Lord. As a father forgives his son, a friend his friend, and a beloved his lover, so should You, O God, bear with me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his profound humility and seeks Krishna's forgiveness after witnessing the terrifying Universal Form. Having been overwhelmed by the cosmic vision and having spoken hastily in the past out of familiarity, Arjuna now prostrates himself completely before the Lord. He acknowledges Krishna as the supreme Lord worthy of all worship (īśam īḍyam) and seeks His grace (prasāda).\n\nArjuna uses three beautiful analogies to appeal to Krishna's compassion: the relationship between father and son, between friends, and between lovers. These relationships represent different dimensions of love and forgiveness - parental indulgence, friendly tolerance, and romantic devotion. Through these comparisons, Arjuna suggests that just as these relationships naturally involve forgiveness for transgressions born of intimacy, so too should the Lord forgive any disrespect shown by him due to their close friendship. This verse demonstrates the devotional aspect of yoga, where complete surrender (praṇipāta) and seeking divine grace become the means of spiritual advancement.\n\nThis verse is significant in the context of bhakti (devotion) in the Gita. It shows that even after the highest philosophical knowledge and the most profound vision, the relationship between devotee and God remains one of loving surrender. Arjuna's appeal reflects the understanding that divine grace is essential for spiritual progress, and that approaching God with humility and love is the appropriate response to His majesty.",
