  "sanskrit": "सत्त्वं सुखे सञ्जयति रजः कर्मणि भारत।\nज्ञानमावृत्य तु तमः प्रमादे सञ्जयत्युत।।14.9।।",
  "transliteration": "sattvaṁ sukhe sañjayati rajaḥ karmaṇi bhārata |\njñānam āvṛtya tu tamaḥ pramāde sañjayaty uta ||14.9||",
  "translation": "Sattva attaches one to happiness, rajas to action, O Bharata, while tamas, veiling knowledge, binds one to heedlessness and negligence.",
  "commentary": "This verse succinctly summarizes the binding effects of each of the three gunas on the embodied soul. Krishna explains that sattva guna, though the most refined of the three qualities, still creates bondage by attaching the individual to happiness and pleasure. Rajas binds through constant engagement in action and the fruits thereof, keeping one perpetually active and restless. Tamas operates differently—it first covers or veils discriminative knowledge (jñāna) and then binds the person to carelessness, delusion, and inertia.\n\nThe verse is particularly significant in understanding why even sattvic qualities, though superior to the other two gunas, must eventually be transcended for liberation. Each guna creates its own form of attachment: sattva through the subtle bondage to joy and knowledge, rajas through compulsive activity and desire for results, and tamas through ignorance and negligence. This teaching prepares the ground for the later verses that describe how to transcend all three gunas and attain the state beyond the gunas (guṇātīta).\n\nThe practical implication is that spiritual aspirants must be vigilant about all three forms of bondage. While cultivating sattva is necessary for spiritual progress, one must not become attached even to sattvic experiences of peace and happiness. The ultimate goal is to witness all three gunas operating in nature while remaining unidentified with any of them, established in one's true nature as pure consciousness.",
