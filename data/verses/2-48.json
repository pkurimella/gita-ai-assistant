  "translation": "Established in yoga, perform actions, having abandoned attachment, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna). Be balanced in success and failure alike; such equanimity is called yoga.",
  "commentary": "This verse is one of the most celebrated in the Bhagavad Gita, providing a foundational definition of yoga as equanimity (samatva). Krishna instructs Arjuna to perform his duties while established in yoga, which means maintaining a state of inner balance regardless of external outcomes. The key is to abandon attachment (saṅga) to the fruits of action—not the action itself. This teaching addresses the central dilemma of the Gita: how to act in the world without being bound by karma.\n\nThe phrase 'samatvaṁ yoga ucyate' (equanimity is called yoga) has become a cornerstone of Hindu philosophy. It redefines yoga not merely as physical postures or meditation techniques, but as a state of mental equilibrium that remains undisturbed by the dualities of life—success and failure, pleasure and pain, gain and loss. This equanimity is not indifference or apathy, but rather a state of inner stability that allows one to act with full engagement while remaining detached from outcomes.\n\nThis verse connects directly to the earlier teachings in this chapter about transcending the pairs of opposites (dvandva) and establishes the practical foundation for Karma Yoga. By maintaining equanimity, one transforms ordinary action into spiritual practice, making every deed an offering rather than a means of personal gain. This teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Arjuna's warrior duty, where success and failure, life and death, are immediate realities that must be faced with steadiness of mind.",
