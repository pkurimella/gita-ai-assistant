  "sanskrit": "अन्ये च बहवः शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविताः।\nनानाशस्त्रप्रहरणाः सर्वे युद्धविशारदाः॥",
  "transliteration": "anye ca bahavaḥ śūrā madarthe tyaktajīvitāḥ |\nnānāśastrapraharaṇāḥ sarve yuddhaviśāradāḥ ||",
  "translation": "And there are many other heroes who are ready to lay down their lives for my sake. They are all skilled in warfare and armed with various weapons.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Duryodhana continues his enumeration of the mighty warriors assembled on the Kaurava side. After naming the principal commanders in the previous verses, he now refers to numerous other brave warriors who have pledged their loyalty to him. The phrase 'madarthe tyaktajīvitāḥ' (ready to sacrifice their lives for my sake) reveals Duryodhana's confidence in the devotion of his army, though it also hints at his egoistic nature in viewing their sacrifice as being for his personal cause rather than for dharma.\n\nDuryodhana emphasizes two key qualities of these warriors: they are equipped with diverse weapons (nānāśastrapraharaṇāḥ) and are all expert in the art of warfare (yuddhaviśāradāḥ). This description serves to boost the morale of his own forces while also revealing his strategic assessment of military strength. However, from the broader perspective of the Gita's teaching, this verse illustrates how Duryodhana's evaluation is purely material and tactical, based on numbers, weapons, and skill, without any consideration of the moral or spiritual dimensions of the impending war. This sets up the contrast with the deeper philosophical inquiry that will unfold through Arjuna's crisis and Krishna's teachings in the subsequent chapters.",
