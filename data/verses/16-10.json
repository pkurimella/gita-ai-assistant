  "transliteration": "kāmam āśritya duṣpūraṁ dambha-māna-madānvitāḥ |\nmohād gṛhītvāsad-grāhān pravartante 'śuci-vratāḥ ||10||",
  "translation": "Taking refuge in insatiable desire, filled with hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding wrong views through delusion, they act with impure resolves and engage in actions that are unclean.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the fundamental characteristics of those possessing demoniac nature (āsurī sampat). Krishna explains that such individuals are driven by insatiable desires (kāma) that can never be fulfilled, no matter how much they acquire. They are characterized by three primary defects: dambha (hypocrisy or pretentiousness), māna (pride or self-conceit), and mada (arrogance or intoxication with power). These qualities cloud their judgment and lead them to adopt false values and principles.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that due to delusion (moha), these individuals embrace wrong philosophies and incorrect understanding of reality (asad-grāhān). They reject the eternal principles of dharma and instead follow their own whims and desires. Their actions and vows (vratas) are impure (aśuci) because they are motivated by selfish desires rather than spiritual principles. This verse sets the stage for the subsequent verses that further elaborate on the destructive nature of demoniac qualities.\n\nIn the broader context of the Gita's teachings, this verse serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked desire and ego. It contrasts sharply with the divine qualities described earlier in the chapter, highlighting how the demoniac path leads to spiritual degradation and suffering. The emphasis on wrong understanding (asad-grāhān) underscores the importance of right knowledge and discrimination in spiritual life.",
