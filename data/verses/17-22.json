  "translation": "Charity given at the wrong place and time, to unworthy persons, without respect or with contempt, is declared to be of the nature of tamas (ignorance).",
  "commentary": "This verse completes Krishna's exposition on the three types of charity (dāna) by describing tamasic charity. Such charity is characterized by four defects: it is given at an improper place (adeśa) and improper time (akāla), to unworthy recipients (apātra), and is given disrespectfully (asat-kṛta) or with contempt (avajñāta). The wrong place might be a location where charity causes harm rather than good, and the wrong time refers to occasions when giving is inappropriate or when the giver cannot afford it. Unworthy recipients are those who will misuse the gift or who are not genuinely in need.\n\nThe manner of giving is equally important as what is given. Tamasic charity lacks the essential element of respect and reverence that should accompany the act of giving. It may be given grudgingly, with insults, or with the intention to humiliate the recipient. Such charity, though materially beneficial, is spiritually degrading for both the giver and receiver. This verse emphasizes that true charity must consider not only the material aspect but also the spiritual dimension—the attitude, timing, place, and worthiness of the recipient. When these factors are ignored due to ignorance or delusion, the act falls into the category of tamas and binds the doer rather than liberating them.",
