  "sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nसंन्यासं कर्मणां कृष्ण पुनर्योगं च शंससि।\nयच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम्।।",
  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nsaṁnyāsaṁ karmaṇāṁ kṛṣṇa punar yogaṁ ca śaṁsasi |\nyac chreya etayor ekaṁ tan me brūhi suniścitam ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Krishna, You praise renunciation of actions (sannyasa) and then again You praise the yoga of action (karma yoga). Tell me decisively which one of these two is better.",
  "commentary": "This opening verse of Chapter 5 reveals Arjuna's continued confusion regarding the path he should follow. Throughout the previous chapters, Krishna has discussed both the path of knowledge with renunciation (sannyasa) and the path of selfless action (karma yoga). Arjuna, seeking clarity, directly asks Krishna to definitively state which path is superior. This question reflects a common dilemma faced by spiritual seekers who encounter seemingly contradictory teachings.\n\nArjuna's confusion is understandable because Krishna has emphasized different aspects of spiritual practice in different contexts. In Chapter 3, Krishna strongly advocated for karma yoga, urging Arjuna to fight. In Chapter 4, He spoke about the renunciation of the fruits of action and transcendental knowledge. Now Arjuna wants a clear, unambiguous answer about which path leads more directly to liberation. This verse sets the stage for Krishna's teaching in Chapter 5, where He will explain that both paths ultimately lead to the same goal, though karma yoga is more practical for most people. Krishna will clarify that true renunciation is not the mere abandonment of action, but the renunciation of attachment and ego while performing one's duties.",
