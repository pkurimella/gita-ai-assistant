  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a practical concern about the practice of yoga by emphasizing the importance of moderation and balance in daily life. After describing the austere requirements of meditation in previous verses, he now clarifies that yoga is not meant for those who go to extremes in any aspect of life. The repeated use of 'yukta' (regulated/moderate) emphasizes that success in yoga requires a balanced approach to eating, recreation, work, sleep, and wakefulness.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant because it makes yoga accessible and practical for ordinary practitioners. Krishna is not advocating extreme asceticism or self-mortification, nor is he endorsing excessive indulgence. Instead, he prescribes the middle path—eating neither too much nor too little, working neither excessively nor lazily, sleeping neither too much nor too little. This balanced lifestyle creates the optimal conditions for spiritual practice and meditation.\n\nThe verse concludes with the promise that such regulated yoga practice becomes 'duḥkha-hā'—the destroyer of all sorrows. This indicates that the miseries of material existence, including physical discomfort, mental agitation, and spiritual ignorance, can be eliminated through disciplined yet balanced practice. This verse serves as a bridge between the ideal of meditation and its practical application in daily life, making the path of yoga realistic and attainable for sincere seekers.",
