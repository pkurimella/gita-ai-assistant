  "translation": "I, having become the fire of digestion (Vaishvanara) dwelling in the bodies of all living beings, united with the incoming and outgoing breaths, digest the four kinds of food.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals another aspect of His all-pervading presence by identifying Himself with the digestive fire (Vaishvanara) that resides in all living beings. This fire, working in conjunction with prana (incoming breath) and apana (outgoing breath), enables the digestion of food. The four kinds of food mentioned refer to that which is chewed (bhakshya), sucked (choshya), licked (lehya), and drunk (peya). This demonstrates that even the most basic biological functions are sustained by the Divine presence.\n\nThis verse fits within the broader theme of Chapter 15, which establishes Krishna as the Supreme Person (Purushottama) who pervades and sustains all existence. After describing the cosmic tree and the nature of the imperishable and perishable, Krishna now illustrates His immanence in the most intimate aspects of life. The digestive process, essential for maintaining life, is shown to be a divine function, elevating even mundane bodily processes to sacred status.\n\nPhilosophically, this teaching emphasizes that there is no aspect of existence, however ordinary or biological, that is separate from the Divine. It bridges the gap between the transcendent Supreme Being and the immanent presence within creation. This understanding cultivates a sense of reverence for all life processes and helps the spiritual seeker recognize the divine presence in every aspect of existence, from the cosmic to the cellular level.",
