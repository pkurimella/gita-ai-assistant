  "transliteration": "jñeyaṁ yat tat pravakṣyāmi yaj jñātvāmṛtam aśnute |\nanādimat paraṁ brahma na sat tan nāsad ucyate ||12||",
  "translation": "I shall now describe that which is to be known, knowing which one attains immortality. It is the beginningless Supreme Brahman, which is said to be neither existent (sat) nor non-existent (asat).",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial transition in Chapter 13, where Krishna shifts from describing the qualities of the knower (jñānī) to revealing the ultimate object of knowledge (jñeya) - Brahman itself. Krishna promises to explain that supreme reality which, when known, leads to immortality (amṛta), the state of liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This is the highest goal of spiritual knowledge, transcending mere intellectual understanding to reach direct realization.\n\nThe description of Brahman as 'anādimat param' (beginningless and supreme) and as neither sat (existent) nor asat (non-existent) points to its transcendental nature beyond all dualities and conceptual categories. It cannot be called 'existent' in the way material objects exist, nor 'non-existent' like a fantasy, because it is the very ground of all existence. This paradoxical description indicates that Brahman transcends ordinary logic and can only be realized through direct spiritual experience. The verse establishes the foundation for the subsequent verses which will describe the all-pervading nature of this Supreme Reality, preparing the seeker for the highest knowledge that liberates.",
