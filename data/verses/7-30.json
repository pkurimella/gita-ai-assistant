  "sanskrit": "साधिभूताधिदैवं मां साधियज्ञं च ये विदुः ।\nप्रयाणकालेऽपि च मां ते विदुर्युक्तचेतसः ॥",
  "transliteration": "sādhibhūtādhidaivaṁ māṁ sādhiyajñaṁ ca ye viduḥ |\nprayāṇa-kāle'pi ca māṁ te vidur yukta-cetasaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those who know Me as the governing principle of the physical elements (Adhibhuta), the cosmic principles (Adhidaiva), and the principle of sacrifice (Adhiyajna), with their minds steadfast in yoga, know Me even at the time of death.",
  "commentary": "This verse concludes Chapter 7 by introducing three crucial metaphysical concepts that will be elaborated in Chapter 8. Krishna declares that those who understand Him as Adhibhuta (the basis of all physical elements), Adhidaiva (the presiding deity of the cosmic forces), and Adhiyajna (the inner controller of all sacrifices) possess complete knowledge. These three terms represent different aspects of the Supreme Reality's manifestation in the material world.\n\nThe phrase 'prayāṇa-kāle' (at the time of death) is particularly significant, as it emphasizes that true knowledge is not merely intellectual but transformative. Those who are 'yukta-cetasaḥ' (with minds united in yoga) maintain their awareness of the Divine even during the critical moment of death, when consciousness typically becomes disturbed. This verse serves as a bridge to Chapter 8, where Arjuna will specifically ask about these technical terms and their meanings, and Krishna will explain the importance of remembering the Divine at death. The verse underscores that spiritual knowledge must be so deeply integrated that it remains accessible even in the most challenging circumstances, demonstrating the practical application of jnana-vijnana (knowledge and realized wisdom) discussed throughout this chapter.",
