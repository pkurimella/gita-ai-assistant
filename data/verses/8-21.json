  "translation": "That which is called the Unmanifest and the Imperishable is declared to be the Supreme Goal. Having reached That, one does not return. That is My Supreme Abode.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the ultimate destination of the spiritual aspirant—His Supreme Abode, which is characterized as both Avyakta (Unmanifest) and Akṣara (Imperishable). This realm transcends all material manifestations and remains eternally unchanging. Unlike the temporary heavenly planets described earlier in the chapter, from which one must eventually return to the material world, this Supreme Abode represents the final liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this Supreme Goal is Krishna's own divine realm, establishing the personal aspect of the Absolute Truth. Those who reach this destination through devotion and spiritual practice attain complete freedom from material existence—they never return to the world of suffering and transmigration. This stands in contrast to those who attain temporary celestial realms through ritualistic practices or meditation on lower aspects of divinity. The use of 'mama' (My) indicates Krishna's personal nature and His supreme position as the ultimate shelter and destination of all souls, reinforcing the devotional path as the means to reach this imperishable state beyond all material designations.",
