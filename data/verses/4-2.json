  "sanskrit": "एवं परम्परा प्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः ।\nस कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप ॥२॥",
  "transliteration": "evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ |\nsa kāleneha mahatā yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa ||2||",
  "translation": "This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in the course of time, O scorcher of enemies, this yoga has been lost to the world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the historical transmission of the ancient yoga system. The knowledge was passed down through 'paramparā' (disciplic succession) from teacher to worthy disciple, and was particularly known to the 'rājarṣis' (royal sages) - enlightened kings who combined spiritual wisdom with worldly governance. This indicates that spiritual knowledge and practical action are not mutually exclusive, a key theme of the Gita.\n\nKrishna then laments that over the vast passage of time ('kālena mahatā'), this sacred knowledge has been lost or distorted. This sets up the context for why Krishna is now revealing this ancient wisdom again to Arjuna. The loss of this knowledge represents a decline in dharma and spiritual understanding in society, necessitating divine intervention through avatāras who restore the eternal teachings.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of authentic transmission of spiritual knowledge through a proper lineage. It suggests that true wisdom is not merely intellectual but must be received from realized teachers and practiced with dedication. By addressing Arjuna as 'parantapa' (scorcher of enemies), Krishna reminds him of his warrior nature while simultaneously preparing to reveal why Arjuna has been chosen as the recipient of this restored ancient wisdom.",
