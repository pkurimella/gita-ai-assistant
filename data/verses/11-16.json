  "transliteration": "aneka-bāhūdara-vaktra-netraṁ paśyāmi tvāṁ sarvato'nanta-rūpam |\nnāntaṁ na madhyaṁ na punas tavādiṁ paśyāmi viśveśvara viśvarūpa ||",
  "translation": "I behold You with infinite forms on all sides, with countless arms, stomachs, faces, and eyes. I see neither Your end, nor Your middle, nor Your beginning, O Lord of the Universe, O Universal Form!",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna describes his overwhelming vision of Krishna's cosmic form (Viśvarūpa). Having been granted divine sight by Krishna, Arjuna witnesses the infinite manifestation of the Supreme Being extending in all directions without limit. The verse emphasizes the boundless nature of the divine through the imagery of countless arms, stomachs, faces, and eyes—representing the omnipresence and omnipotence of God who pervades all creation.\n\nArjuna's inability to perceive a beginning, middle, or end to this form illustrates the transcendental nature of the Supreme Reality, which exists beyond the limitations of time and space. This vision shatters all conventional understanding of form and identity, revealing that the divine essence cannot be contained or comprehended through ordinary perception. The use of the terms 'Viśveśvara' (Lord of the Universe) and 'Viśvarūpa' (Universal Form) emphasizes that what Arjuna witnesses is not merely a magnified form, but the totality of existence itself—all beings, all worlds, and all time compressed into a single vision.\n\nThis verse is significant in establishing the philosophical concept that the Supreme Being is both immanent (present in all forms) and transcendent (beyond all forms). It demonstrates that while God may appear in a personal form for the sake of devotees, His true nature is infinite and all-encompassing, containing within Himself the entire cosmic manifestation past, present, and future.",
