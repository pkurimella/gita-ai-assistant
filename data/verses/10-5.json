  "transliteration": "ahiṁsā samatā tuṣṭis tapo dānaṁ yaśo'yaśaḥ |\nbhavanti bhāvā bhūtānāṁ matta eva pṛthag-vidhāḥ ||5||",
  "translation": "Non-violence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, fame and infamy—these various qualities of beings arise from Me alone.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna continues His enumeration of the divine qualities and mental states that originate from Him. He lists seven important virtues and conditions: ahiṁsā (non-violence or non-injury in thought, word, and deed), samatā (equanimity or evenness of mind in pleasure and pain), tuṣṭi (contentment with what one has), tapas (austerity or self-discipline), dāna (charity or giving), and the pair of yaśa and ayaśa (fame and infamy). The inclusion of both fame and infamy is significant, indicating that Krishna is the source of all dualities and experiences in creation.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the fundamental Vedantic teaching that all qualities, whether considered positive or negative by human standards, ultimately emanate from the Supreme Reality. Krishna is establishing His position as the ultimate source of all mental dispositions and moral qualities in beings. The phrase 'pṛthag-vidhāḥ' (of various kinds) indicates the diversity of these qualities as they manifest in different beings according to their karma and nature. This understanding helps the spiritual aspirant recognize the divine hand behind all phenomena and cultivate the positive qualities while transcending identification with both praise and blame. The verse serves the larger purpose of Chapter 10, which is to reveal Krishna's vibhūti (divine glories and manifestations) so that Arjuna can develop deeper devotion and understanding of the all-pervading nature of the Supreme.",
