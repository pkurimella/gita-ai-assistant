  "sanskrit": "समः शत्रौ च मित्रे च तथा मानापमानयोः |\nशीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु समः सङ्गविवर्जितः ||१८||",
  "transliteration": "samaḥ śatrau ca mitre ca tathā mānāpamānayoḥ |\nśītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkheṣu samaḥ saṅga-vivarjitaḥ ||18||",
  "translation": "One who is equal toward friend and foe, in honor and dishonor, in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, and who is free from attachment.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of the qualities of a true devotee, emphasizing the principle of equanimity (samatva) in all circumstances. The devotee maintains perfect balance whether dealing with enemies or friends, receiving honor or dishonor, experiencing physical discomfort like cold and heat, or facing the dualities of pleasure and pain. This equanimity is not mere indifference or apathy, but arises from a deeper understanding that all these dualities are temporary manifestations of prakriti (material nature) and do not affect the eternal soul.\n\nThe phrase 'saṅga-vivarjitaḥ' (free from attachment) is crucial here, as it explains the foundation of this equanimity. The devotee has transcended attachment to outcomes, people, and circumstances because their consciousness is anchored in the Supreme. This detachment does not mean abandoning duties or relationships, but rather performing them without being emotionally enslaved by them. Such a person has achieved the state of sthitaprajna (steady wisdom) described earlier in the Gita, where external circumstances no longer disturb the inner peace. This quality is essential for bhakti yoga because attachment and aversion create mental disturbances that obstruct the flow of devotion and prevent one from maintaining constant remembrance of the Divine.",
