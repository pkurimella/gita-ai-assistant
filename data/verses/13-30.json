  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Distinction between the Field and the Knower of the Field",
  "sanskrit": "प्रकृत्यैव च कर्माणि क्रियमाणानि सर्वशः |\nयः पश्यति तथात्मानमकर्तारं स पश्यति ||",
  "transliteration": "prakṛtyaiva ca karmāṇi kriyamāṇāni sarvaśaḥ |\nyaḥ paśyati tathātmānam akartāraṁ sa paśyati ||",
  "translation": "One who sees that all actions are performed entirely by Prakriti (material nature) alone, and that the Self is not the doer—such a person truly sees.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a fundamental teaching of Sankhya philosophy integrated into the Gita's framework. Krishna explains that true vision consists in recognizing that all actions are performed by Prakriti—the material nature consisting of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas). The physical body, senses, mind, and intellect are all modifications of Prakriti, and it is through these instruments that all activities occur. The Self (Atman), being pure consciousness, remains ever untouched and uninvolved in action.\n\nThis understanding liberates one from the false identification with being the doer (kartṛtva) and the experiencer (bhoktṛtva). When one realizes that the Self is merely the witness consciousness, distinct from the body-mind complex which is part of the field (kshetra), one attains true knowledge. This verse directly relates to the chapter's central theme of distinguishing between kshetra (the field) and kshetrajna (the knower of the field). The person who comprehends this distinction understands that while the body acts through the agency of Prakriti, the Self remains the eternal, unchanging witness, never actually performing any action. This realization is essential for spiritual liberation, as it dissolves the ego's false claim of doership and the karmic bondage that follows from such identification.",
