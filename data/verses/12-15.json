  "sanskrit": "यस्मान्नोद्विजते लोको लोकान्नोद्विजते च यः |\nहर्षामर्षभयोद्वेगैर्मुक्तो यः स च मे प्रियः ||१५||",
  "transliteration": "yasmān nodvijate loko lokān nodvijate ca yaḥ |\nharṣāmarṣa-bhayodvegair mukto yaḥ sa ca me priyaḥ ||15||",
  "translation": "One who does not agitate the world, and whom the world cannot agitate, who is freed from joy, envy, fear, and anxiety—such a person is dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the ideal devotee as one who maintains perfect equilibrium in their relationship with the world. The devotee neither causes disturbance to others through their actions, words, or thoughts, nor becomes disturbed by the actions of others. This represents a state of complete emotional maturity and spiritual stability. The verse emphasizes bidirectional harmony—the devotee neither projects negativity outward nor absorbs it from external sources.\n\nThe four emotions mentioned—harṣa (elation), amarṣa (intolerance or envy), bhaya (fear), and udvega (anxiety)—represent the primary disturbances that affect human consciousness. Freedom from these indicates a state of inner liberation even while living in the world. Such a person has transcended the dualities of pleasure and pain, success and failure, praise and blame. This emotional equanimity is not mere suppression or indifference, but arises from deep spiritual understanding and devotion to the Divine.\n\nThis verse connects to the broader theme of Chapter 12, which describes the characteristics of true devotees. The ability to remain undisturbed and non-disturbing reflects the sthitaprajña (steady wisdom) described in Chapter 2, showing the consistency of Krishna's teachings. Such a devotee, established in inner peace, naturally becomes dear to the Lord because they embody divine qualities and serve as instruments of peace in the world.",
