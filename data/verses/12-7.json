  "translation": "For those who fix their minds on Me alone, who worship Me with exclusive devotion, I swiftly become their savior from the ocean of death and transmigration, O Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents Krishna's profound promise to devotees who surrender completely to Him. Krishna declares that for those whose consciousness is fully absorbed in Him (mayy āveśita-cetasām), He personally becomes their deliverer from the ocean of birth and death (mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgara). The use of the word 'śīghram' (swiftly) and 'na cirāt' (without delay) emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of divine grace for sincere devotees.\n\nThe metaphor of the ocean of saṁsāra is particularly significant in Vedantic literature. Just as an ocean is vast, deep, and difficult to cross, the cycle of birth and death appears insurmountable through individual effort alone. However, Krishna assures that through complete devotion and surrender, He Himself takes responsibility for the devotee's liberation. This verse establishes the supremacy of bhakti yoga, showing that divine grace accelerates the spiritual journey far beyond what can be achieved through individual striving alone.\n\nThis promise is especially relevant in the context of Chapter 12, where Arjuna has asked about the relative merits of worshiping the personal form versus the impersonal Absolute. Krishna's assurance here demonstrates the accessibility and efficacy of devotional worship, where the Supreme takes personal interest in the welfare of the devotee. This reciprocal relationship between the devotee and the Divine is the essence of bhakti yoga, making it a path suitable for all seekers regardless of their intellectual or spiritual capacity.",
