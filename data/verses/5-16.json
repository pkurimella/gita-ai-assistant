  "sanskrit": "ज्ञानेन तु तदज्ञानं येषां नाशितमात्मनः।\nतेषामादित्यवज्ज्ञानं प्रकाशयति तत्परम्॥",
  "transliteration": "jñānena tu tad ajñānaṁ yeṣāṁ nāśitam ātmanaḥ |\nteṣām āditya-vaj jñānaṁ prakāśayati tat param ||",
  "translation": "But for those whose ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self, that knowledge, like the sun, illuminates the Supreme Reality.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a beautiful metaphor comparing spiritual knowledge to the sun. Just as the sun dispels darkness and reveals all objects clearly, true knowledge (jñāna) destroys the ignorance (ajñāna) that obscures our understanding of the Self and Supreme Reality. The ignorance referred to here is not mere lack of information, but the fundamental misidentification of the Self with the body-mind complex, which is the root cause of all suffering and bondage.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that when this primordial ignorance is removed through Self-knowledge, the Supreme Reality (tat param) becomes self-evident and luminous. The comparison to the sun (āditya-vat) is particularly apt because the sun is self-luminous and requires no other source to reveal itself, just as the Self is self-evident when ignorance is removed. This verse is central to the chapter's theme of karma-sannyasa yoga, showing that true renunciation comes not merely from abandoning actions, but from the wisdom that reveals one's true nature.\n\nThis teaching forms the foundation of Jnana Yoga, the path of knowledge, and demonstrates that liberation is not something to be achieved or created, but rather the natural state that shines forth when the veiling power of ignorance is removed. The verse assures seekers that through proper knowledge and discrimination, the darkness of ignorance can be permanently dispelled, leading to the direct realization of one's divine nature.",
