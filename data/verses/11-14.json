  "sanskrit": "ततः स विस्मयाविष्टो हृष्टरोमा धनञ्जयः।\nप्रणम्य शिरसा देवं कृताञ्जलिरभाषत॥",

  "translation": "Then Arjuna, filled with wonder and with his hair standing on end, bowed his head before the Divine Lord and spoke with joined palms.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes Arjuna's immediate reaction upon witnessing the cosmic form (Viśvarūpa) of Lord Krishna. The verse captures the profound psychological and physical impact of the divine vision. Arjuna is described as 'vismayāviṣṭa' (filled with wonder) and 'hṛṣṭa-romā' (with hair standing on end), indicating both awe and a sense of the numinous that overwhelms his entire being. This physiological response—the standing of hair on end—is a classical indication in Sanskrit literature of experiencing something that transcends ordinary human comprehension.\n\nArjuna's response is one of complete reverence and devotion. Despite being Krishna's friend and companion throughout the epic, he now recognizes the full divine nature of the Lord and responds with the appropriate gestures of worship—bowing his head (praṇamya śirasā) and joining his palms (kṛtāñjali). This marks a significant shift in their relationship, from the familiar dialogue of the earlier chapters to a devotee's encounter with the Supreme Reality. The verse serves as a transition from the granting of the divine vision to Arjuna's hymn of praise that follows.\n\nThis moment represents the culmination of Arjuna's spiritual preparation through the previous ten chapters. The vision is so overwhelming that it transforms his consciousness entirely, moving him from intellectual understanding to direct experiential knowledge of the Divine. His spontaneous devotional response demonstrates that true knowledge of God naturally gives rise to bhakti (devotion), illustrating the inseparable connection between jñāna and bhakti in the Gita's philosophy.",
