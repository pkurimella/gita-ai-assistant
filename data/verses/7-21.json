  "transliteration": "yo yo yāṁ yāṁ tanuṁ bhaktaḥ śraddhayārcitum icchati |\ntasya tasyācalāṁ śraddhāṁ tām eva vidadhāmy aham ||21||",
  "translation": "Whatever form any devotee with faith wishes to worship, I make that very faith of his steady and unflinching.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound truth about divine grace and the nature of worship. He explains that regardless of which deity or form a devotee chooses to worship with faith, it is Krishna himself who stabilizes and strengthens that faith. This demonstrates the supreme position of Krishna as the ultimate controller and source of all divine manifestations. The verse shows Krishna's compassionate acceptance of all forms of sincere worship, even when directed toward other deities.\n\nThis teaching is significant within Chapter 7's theme of knowledge and wisdom because it reveals how the Supreme Being operates through all forms of worship. Krishna does not reject those who worship other deities; instead, He empowers their faith, knowing that all worship ultimately reaches Him. However, as subsequent verses will clarify, those who worship demigods receive temporary, limited results, while those who worship Krishna directly attain the supreme goal. This verse demonstrates both Krishna's universal presence and His role as the inner controller (antaryāmin) who guides all beings according to their desires and level of understanding.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that faith itself is a gift from the Divine. No one can maintain steady faith without divine grace. This verse also establishes the framework for understanding religious pluralism within Vedantic thought—all paths are acknowledged, but they are not all equal in their ultimate destination. Krishna's statement reveals His impartiality and simultaneous supremacy, as He facilitates all worship while remaining the ultimate object worthy of worship.",
