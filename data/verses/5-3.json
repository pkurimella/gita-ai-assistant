  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Renunciation of Action",
  "sanskrit": "ज्ञेयः स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति।\nनिर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "jñeyaḥ sa nitya-saṁnyāsī yo na dveṣṭi na kāṅkṣati |\nnirdvandvo hi mahā-bāho sukhaṁ bandhāt pramucyate ||",
  "translation": "He who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities should be known as one who is always renounced. Free from all dualities, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily liberated from bondage.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna defines the true nature of a sannyasi (renunciant). Rather than focusing on external renunciation of action, Krishna emphasizes the internal state of mind. A true renunciant is one who has transcended both aversion (dvesha) and desire (kanksha) for the results of actions. This person performs duties without attachment to outcomes, neither rejoicing in success nor lamenting failure. This teaching resolves Arjuna's confusion from the beginning of the chapter about whether sannyasa or karma yoga is superior, showing that true renunciation is an internal attitude that can coexist with action.\n\nThe term 'nirdvandva' (free from dualities) is crucial here, referring to freedom from pairs of opposites like pleasure-pain, success-failure, honor-dishonor. When one transcends these dualities through equanimity, one naturally becomes free from bondage. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'maha-baho' (mighty-armed), reminding him of his warrior nature while teaching that true strength lies not in physical prowess but in mental equilibrium. This verse establishes that the essence of renunciation is not the abandonment of action but the abandonment of desire and aversion, making karma yoga and sannyasa complementary rather than contradictory paths. Such a person attains liberation 'sukham' (easily) because they are no longer creating new karmic bonds through attachment.",
