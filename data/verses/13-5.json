  "sanskrit": "ऋषिभिर्बहुधा गीतं छन्दोभिर्विविधैः पृथक् ।\nब्रह्मसूत्रपदैश्चैव हेतुमद्भिर्विनिश्चितैः ॥५॥",
  "transliteration": "ṛṣibhir bahudhā gītaṁ chandobhir vividhaiḥ pṛthak |\nbrahma-sūtra-padaiś caiva hetumadbhir viniścitaiḥ ||5||",
  "translation": "This knowledge has been sung by the sages in many ways, in various distinctive hymns and Vedic chants, and also in the well-reasoned and conclusive verses of the Brahma-sūtras.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the authority and validity of the knowledge He is about to impart regarding the field (kṣetra) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña). He references three sources of authority: the ancient rishis (seers) who have expounded this wisdom in diverse ways, the Vedic hymns (chandas) which contain this knowledge in various meters and forms, and the Brahma-sūtras—the aphoristic texts that systematically present the philosophy of Brahman with logical reasoning.\n\nBy citing these authoritative sources, Krishna emphasizes that the teaching about the distinction between matter and spirit, body and soul, is not a novel doctrine but an ancient and well-established truth validated by scripture, logic, and the experience of realized sages. The reference to 'hetumadbhiḥ viniścitaiḥ' (well-reasoned and conclusive) indicates that this knowledge is not based on blind faith but is supported by sound reasoning and definitive conclusions. This verse serves as a bridge, assuring Arjuna that the profound metaphysical knowledge about to be revealed has the backing of the entire Vedic tradition and stands on firm philosophical ground.",
