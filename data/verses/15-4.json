  "sanskrit": "ततः पदं तत्परिमार्गितव्यं यस्मिन्गता न निवर्तन्ति भूयः ।\nतमेव चाद्यं पुरुषं प्रपद्ये यतः प्रवृत्तिः प्रसृता पुराणी ॥४॥",
  "transliteration": "tataḥ padaṃ tat parimārgitavyaṃ yasmin gatā na nivartanti bhūyaḥ |\ntam eva cādyaṃ puruṣaṃ prapadye yataḥ pravṛttiḥ prasṛtā purāṇī ||4||",
  "translation": "Then that supreme abode must be sought, reaching which seekers do not return again. I take refuge in that Primordial Being from whom this ancient cosmic manifestation has streamed forth.",
  "commentary": "After describing the inverted tree of saṃsāra in the previous verses, Krishna now directs Arjuna toward the ultimate goal—the transcendent realm beyond this material existence. This verse provides the essential instruction: one must seek that supreme state (padam) from which there is no return to the cycle of birth and death. This is the state of mokṣa or liberation, characterized by eternal freedom from saṃsāra.\n\nThe verse emphasizes surrender (prapadye) to the Primordial Person (ādyaṃ puruṣam), the Supreme Being who is the source of all cosmic manifestation. This ancient emanation (purāṇī pravṛttiḥ) refers to the beginningless flow of creation that has proceeded from the Supreme. Krishna identifies Himself as this original source, indicating that devotion and surrender to Him is the means to reach that supreme abode. The path involves both knowledge (understanding the illusory nature of the material world) and devotion (taking complete refuge in the Supreme).\n\nThis verse is pivotal in the chapter as it transitions from the diagnostic description of material bondage to the prescription for liberation. It establishes that the goal is not merely intellectual understanding but actual realization and attainment of the transcendent state through surrender to the Supreme Person, who is both the origin and the ultimate destination of all existence.",
