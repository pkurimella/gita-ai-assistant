  "transliteration": "yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha |\nsama-duḥkha-sukhaṁ dhīraṁ so'mṛtatvāya kalpate ||",
  "translation": "O best among men (Arjuna), the person who is not disturbed by these (sensory experiences), who remains equipoised in pleasure and pain, and who is steady—such a wise one becomes eligible for immortality.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna builds upon the previous teaching about the temporary nature of sensory experiences. He declares that the person who has transcended the dualities of pleasure and pain, who remains unshaken by the contact of the senses with their objects, is truly wise (dhīra). Such equanimity is not mere stoic indifference, but a state of inner stability rooted in the understanding of the eternal Self. The term 'puruṣarṣabha' (best among men) is used to encourage Arjuna, suggesting that this state of equipoise is the mark of true human excellence.\n\nThe verse introduces a crucial concept: immortality (amṛtatva) is attained not through ritual or external means, but through inner steadiness and wisdom. This immortality refers to liberation (mokṣa), the realization of one's eternal nature beyond birth and death. The person who maintains equanimity in the face of life's inevitable ups and downs develops the qualification (kalpate) for this highest spiritual attainment. This teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of karma yoga and jñāna yoga, where action is performed without attachment to results.\n\nThis verse serves as a bridge in Krishna's teaching, moving from the analysis of the temporary nature of sensory experiences to the practical application of this knowledge. It establishes that spiritual maturity is measured not by the absence of challenging circumstances, but by one's response to them. The dhīra (steady person) is one who has cultivated inner strength through discrimination between the eternal and the temporary, and who remains anchored in Self-knowledge regardless of external conditions.",
