  "sanskrit": "न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।\nतत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥",
  "transliteration": "na hi jñānena sadṛśaṁ pavitram iha vidyate |\ntat svayaṁ yoga-saṁsiddhaḥ kālenātmani vindati ||",
  "translation": "Indeed, there is nothing in this world as purifying as knowledge. One who is perfected in yoga discovers this knowledge within oneself in due course of time.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna extols knowledge (jñāna) as the supreme purifier, declaring that nothing in this world can match its sanctifying power. This knowledge is not mere intellectual understanding but the direct realization of the Self and ultimate Reality. It purifies the heart completely, removing all karmic impurities and ignorance that bind the soul to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that this transcendental knowledge is not acquired from external sources alone but is discovered within oneself (ātmani vindati) by one who has become perfected through yoga practice (yoga-saṁsiddhaḥ). The phrase 'in due course of time' (kālena) indicates that this realization comes naturally and spontaneously to the sincere practitioner who has purified the mind through dedicated yogic discipline. It cannot be forced or rushed but unfolds organically as one matures spiritually.\n\nThis verse serves as the culmination of Krishna's teaching in this chapter about karma yoga and jñāna yoga. It reinforces the message that selfless action performed with the right attitude naturally leads to the dawn of spiritual wisdom. The verse bridges the practical path of action with the ultimate goal of Self-realization, showing that they are not separate but complementary aspects of the spiritual journey.",
