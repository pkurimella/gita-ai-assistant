  "translation": "Worshippers of the celestial gods go to the gods; worshippers of ancestors go to the ancestors; worshippers of spirits and ghosts go to them; but My devotees come to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a fundamental principle of spiritual law: one attains that which one worships. This is not merely a statement of religious preference, but a profound psychological and metaphysical truth. The object of one's devotion determines one's destination and ultimate state of consciousness. Those who worship the devas (celestial beings) with specific desires attain temporary heavenly realms. Those who perform rituals for ancestors reach the realm of the pitṛs. Those who propitiate elemental spirits and ghosts remain bound to those lower planes of existence.\n\nThe verse culminates with Krishna's declaration that those who worship Him alone attain Him—the Supreme Reality. This is significant within the context of Chapter 9, which emphasizes the supremacy of devotion to the Supreme Lord over all other forms of worship. While other forms of worship may yield temporary results within the cycle of saṃsāra, devotion to Krishna leads to liberation (mokṣa) and eternal union with the Divine. This verse underscores the teaching that the quality and object of one's faith shapes one's spiritual destiny, encouraging seekers to direct their devotion toward the highest Reality rather than limited, temporary goals.",
