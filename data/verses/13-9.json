  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's enumeration of the qualities of knowledge (jñāna) that began in verse 8. Here, Krishna emphasizes two crucial aspects of spiritual wisdom: detachment from worldly relationships and equanimity in all circumstances. Non-attachment (asakti) does not mean abandoning one's duties or relationships, but rather performing them without possessive clinging. The specific mention of son, wife, and home represents the strongest bonds that typically bind a person to worldly existence. The aspirant must learn to fulfill responsibilities while maintaining inner freedom from excessive emotional dependence.\n\nThe second quality mentioned is sama-cittatva, equanimity of mind, which must be maintained constantly (nityam) whether pleasant or unpleasant events occur. This steadiness of mind is not mere stoicism or suppression of emotions, but a deeper understanding that all dualities—pleasure and pain, gain and loss—are temporary modifications of prakṛti (nature) and do not affect the eternal Self. This teaching aligns with the fundamental Gita principle of performing one's duty while remaining unattached to results. Such equanimity is both a means to knowledge and a sign of true wisdom, as it reflects the understanding that the Self remains unchanged amidst all worldly fluctuations.",
