  "translation": "Mentally renouncing all actions to Me, regarding Me as supreme, taking refuge in the yoga of discrimination, fix your consciousness constantly on Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides Arjuna with a comprehensive instruction for spiritual practice that integrates karma yoga, bhakti yoga, and jnana yoga. He asks Arjuna to mentally dedicate all actions to the Divine (cetasā sarva-karmāṇi mayi saṁnyasya), which represents the essence of karma yoga - performing actions without attachment to results by offering them to God. The phrase 'mat-paraḥ' indicates complete devotion and surrender, making the Lord one's supreme goal and refuge.\n\nThe instruction to take refuge in buddhi-yoga (the yoga of discrimination or intellect) while maintaining constant God-consciousness (mac-cittaḥ satataṁ bhava) shows the integration of wisdom and devotion. Buddhi-yoga here refers to the discriminative faculty that enables one to distinguish between the eternal and temporary, the Self and non-Self. This verse emphasizes that true renunciation is not merely physical abandonment of action, but a mental state of offering and surrender. By maintaining constant awareness of the Divine while performing one's duties with discrimination, the practitioner achieves the highest state of yoga - unity with the Supreme. This teaching is particularly significant in Chapter 18 as it synthesizes the major themes of the Gita into a practical instruction for spiritual life.",
