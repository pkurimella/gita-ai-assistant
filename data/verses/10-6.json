  "translation": "The seven great sages of ancient times, and also the four Manus before them, were born from My mind, endowed with My nature; from them all these creatures in the world have descended.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate His divine manifestations by identifying Himself as the source of the great progenitors of humanity. The seven great sages (saptarṣi) refer to the ancient seers like Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishtha. The four Manus mentioned are the progenitors and lawgivers of different epochs (manvantaras) in cosmic time. Krishna declares that these exalted beings were born directly from His mind (mānasā jātā), not through physical procreation, and were imbued with His divine nature (madbhāvā).\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in establishing the divine origin of cosmic order and human civilization. These mind-born sons of Brahma (who is Himself a manifestation of Krishna) became the ancestors of all living beings in the world. By stating that they possessed His nature, Krishna indicates that they were endowed with divine qualities such as wisdom, righteousness, and creative power. This verse reinforces the teaching that all existence ultimately emanates from the Supreme Divine, and that the spiritual hierarchy of the universe has its foundation in Krishna's consciousness. Understanding this cosmic genealogy helps the spiritual aspirant recognize the divine essence present in all creation and the sacred lineage of wisdom that has been transmitted through these great sages to humanity.",
