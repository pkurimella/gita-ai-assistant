  "sanskrit": "अविभक्तं च भूतेषु विभक्तमिव च स्थितम् |\nभूतभर्तृ च तज्ज्ञेयं ग्रसिष्णु प्रभविष्णु च ||१७||",
  "transliteration": "avibhaktaṁ ca bhūteṣu vibhaktam iva ca sthitam |\nbhūta-bhartṛ ca taj jñeyaṁ grasiṣṇu prabhaviṣṇu ca ||17||",
  "translation": "That which is to be known exists undivided in all beings, yet appears as if divided. It is the sustainer of all beings, and also their devourer and creator.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the paradoxical nature of the Supreme Reality (Brahman) that is to be known. Though the ultimate truth is one indivisible consciousness, it appears to be divided and separate in different beings due to the limiting adjuncts of bodies and minds. Just as space appears divided by pots and walls but remains fundamentally one, the Supreme Self appears fragmented in individual beings while remaining eternally undivided. This is one of the most profound teachings of Advaita Vedanta philosophy.\n\nKrishna further explains that this knowable Reality performs three cosmic functions: it sustains all beings (bhūta-bhartṛ) as Vishnu, destroys them (grasiṣṇu) as Shiva, and creates them (prabhaviṣṇu) as Brahma. These functions of preservation, dissolution, and creation are not separate from the one Reality but are its various expressions. This verse emphasizes that the transcendent Brahman is also immanent, actively involved in the cosmic processes while remaining unchanged in its essential nature. Understanding this non-dual nature of reality is crucial for spiritual liberation.",
