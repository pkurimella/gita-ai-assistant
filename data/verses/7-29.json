  "translation": "Those who take refuge in Me and strive for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman completely, as well as the entire nature of the Self (Adhyatma) and all about action (Karma).",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a transition in Chapter 7, introducing the theme that will be elaborated in Chapter 8. Krishna describes the highest seekers—those who approach Him with the ultimate goal of liberation from the cycle of birth, old age, and death (samsara). Unlike those who worship Him for material gains mentioned in earlier verses, these devotees seek the supreme goal of moksha. By taking complete refuge in Krishna, they gain comprehensive knowledge of multiple dimensions of reality.\n\nThe verse promises that such sincere seekers will come to understand Brahman (the Absolute Reality), Adhyatma (the individual self or the spiritual dimension), and Karma (the complete nature of action and its cosmic implications). This comprehensive knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential wisdom that arises from devoted surrender. The use of 'kṛtsnam' (completely) and 'akhilam' (all) emphasizes the totality of understanding that comes to those who seek refuge in the Divine with the pure motive of liberation. This verse sets up the questions Arjuna will ask at the beginning of Chapter 8 regarding these very terms—Brahman, Adhyatma, and Karma—showing the pedagogical structure of the Gita's teaching.",
