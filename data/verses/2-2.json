  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, from where has this delusion come upon you at this critical hour? It is not befitting a noble person, it does not lead to heaven, and it brings disgrace.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks Krishna's first direct response to Arjuna's emotional breakdown on the battlefield. Krishna addresses Arjuna's sudden onset of weakness and confusion with sharp, challenging words. He questions the source (kutas) of this delusion (kaśmalam) that has overtaken Arjuna precisely at the moment when decisive action is required. Krishna's tone is deliberately provocative, designed to shake Arjuna out of his emotional paralysis.\n\nKrishna employs three powerful arguments against Arjuna's position: First, he states that such behavior is 'anārya-juṣṭam' - not practiced by noble or worthy persons (āryas). This appeals to Arjuna's sense of honor and his identity as a warrior prince. Second, it is 'asvargya' - it does not lead to heaven, addressing the spiritual consequences. Third, it brings 'akīrti' - dishonor and infamy, which for a kṣatriya (warrior) is worse than death itself. Krishna is strategically using conventional dharmic arguments that would resonate with Arjuna's warrior mentality, preparing the ground for the deeper philosophical teachings that will follow.\n\nThis verse sets the pedagogical tone for the entire Gita. Krishna begins not with abstract philosophy but by challenging Arjuna's immediate emotional state and social conditioning. The word 'kaśmalam' (impurity or delusion) is significant - it suggests that Arjuna's compassion, though seemingly noble, is actually a form of confusion that clouds proper judgment. This introduces a key theme of the Gita: the distinction between genuine wisdom and sentiment masquerading as virtue.",
