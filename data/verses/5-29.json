  "translation": "Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all worlds, and the friend of all beings, one attains peace.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 5 presents the essence of attaining true peace (shanti). Krishna reveals three fundamental truths about His nature: He is the ultimate beneficiary and enjoyer of all sacrifices and spiritual practices (bhoktāram yajña-tapasām), He is the Supreme Lord of all worlds and beings (sarva-loka-maheśvaram), and He is the selfless friend of all creatures (suhṛdam sarva-bhūtānām). This threefold knowledge is the key to liberation from anxiety and the attainment of lasting peace.\n\nThis verse synthesizes the teachings of karma-yoga presented throughout the chapter. When one understands that all actions, sacrifices, and austerities ultimately belong to and are enjoyed by the Divine, the ego's claim of doership dissolves. Recognizing God as the Supreme Controller removes the burden of trying to control outcomes, while knowing Him as the universal friend eliminates fear and insecurity. This wisdom transforms one's relationship with action—no longer performed for personal gain but as an offering to the Divine friend and master of all.\n\nThe verse serves as a bridge between the yoga of renunciation of action (karma-sannyasa) discussed in this chapter and the meditation practices to be elaborated in the next chapter. True peace (shanti) is not merely the absence of conflict but the positive state of inner tranquility that comes from right knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme. This peace is the natural result of surrendering to Krishna with full understanding of His nature as the beneficiary, controller, and well-wisher of all existence.",
