  "translation": "O descendant of Kuru, in this path the resolute intellect is single-pointed, but the intellect of the irresolute is many-branched and endless.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna contrasts two types of intellect: the resolute (vyavasāyātmikā) and the irresolute (avyavasāyinām). The resolute intellect, characteristic of one who practices Karma Yoga with determination, is focused on a single goal—Self-realization or union with the Divine. This one-pointed focus allows the practitioner to act without attachment to results, maintaining clarity and purpose in all endeavors.\n\nIn stark contrast, the intellect of the irresolute person branches out endlessly in countless directions. Such individuals are driven by desires for various fruits of action, leading to scattered attention and wavering commitment. Their minds are pulled in multiple directions by different goals, pleasures, and anxieties about outcomes. This fragmentation of purpose prevents spiritual progress and keeps one bound to the cycle of karma and its results.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the practical application of Karma Yoga discussed in this chapter. Krishna emphasizes that true wisdom lies not in the accumulation of knowledge or the pursuit of multiple objectives, but in the singular, unwavering focus on performing one's duty without attachment. This teaching prepares Arjuna to understand that his dharma requires decisive action with a concentrated mind, free from the paralysis of indecision that currently grips him.",
