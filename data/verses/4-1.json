  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: I taught this imperishable yoga to Vivasvan (the sun-god); Vivasvan taught it to Manu (the father of mankind); and Manu taught it to Ikshvaku (the founder of the solar dynasty).",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Chapter 4, where Krishna reveals the ancient lineage of the yoga teaching. Krishna establishes the divine origin and timeless nature of this wisdom by tracing its transmission through a sacred lineage (paramparā): from Himself to Vivasvan (the sun-god), then to Manu (the progenitor of humanity), and subsequently to Ikshvaku (the first king of the solar dynasty). This establishes that the knowledge Krishna is imparting is not new or invented, but rather eternal wisdom that has been preserved through a succession of enlightened teachers.\n\nThe use of the word 'avyayam' (imperishable) is significant, indicating that this yoga is eternal and unchanging, transcending time and circumstance. By revealing this ancient lineage, Krishna accomplishes several purposes: he establishes the authority and authenticity of the teaching, demonstrates that spiritual wisdom must be transmitted through proper disciplic succession, and prepares the ground for the subsequent revelation about his own divine incarnations. This verse sets the context for understanding that the Bhagavad Gita's teachings are part of an ancient, unbroken chain of spiritual knowledge meant to guide humanity through the ages.",
