  "translation": "Behold, O Teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed in battle formation by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Duryodhana addresses his teacher Dronacharya, drawing his attention to the formidable Pandava army. The verse reveals Duryodhana's psychological state as he attempts to bolster his own confidence while subtly criticizing his teacher. By referring to Dhrishtadyumna as 'your intelligent disciple,' Duryodhana reminds Dronacharya that the commander of the opposing army was trained by Dronacharya himself, creating an implicit tension and perhaps questioning the teacher's loyalty.\n\nThis verse is significant in establishing the dramatic irony of the situation. Dhrishtadyumna, son of Drupada, was born specifically to kill Dronacharya, yet Dronacharya had trained him in the military arts. Duryodhana's words carry a veiled accusation and serve to bind Dronacharya more firmly to the Kaurava cause by reminding him of this uncomfortable fact. The verse also demonstrates Duryodhana's cunning diplomatic skills and his understanding of human psychology, as he manipulates his teacher's emotions before the battle begins.",
