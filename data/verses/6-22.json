  "translation": "Having gained this, one considers no other gain to be greater; established in this state, one is not shaken even by the heaviest sorrow.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the supreme nature of the state achieved through yoga meditation. Krishna emphasizes that when a practitioner attains this yogic realization, they recognize it as the highest possible achievement, beyond which there is nothing more valuable to be gained. This is not mere philosophical speculation but a direct experiential understanding that transcends all worldly acquisitions and even spiritual attainments of lesser degrees.\n\nThe second half of the verse reveals the extraordinary stability and equanimity that comes with this realization. The phrase 'guruṇāpi duḥkhena' (even by the heaviest sorrow) indicates that no amount of suffering—whether physical, mental, or emotional—can disturb one who is established in this yogic state. This immovability is not due to suppression or denial of pain, but arises from the profound inner peace and self-realization that makes one transcendent to dualities.\n\nThis verse connects directly to the chapter's central theme of dhyana yoga by illustrating the ultimate fruit of meditation practice. It serves as both an inspiration and a benchmark for practitioners, showing that the goal of yoga is not merely stress reduction or mental calm, but a fundamental transformation of consciousness that provides unshakeable peace regardless of external circumstances. This state represents the practical fulfillment of yoga's promise—complete freedom from suffering through self-realization.",
