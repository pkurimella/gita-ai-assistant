  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents Arjuna with a clear choice and its consequences. He promises that by maintaining consciousness fixed on the Divine (mac-cittaḥ), one will transcend all difficulties and obstacles (sarva-durgāṇi) through divine grace (mat-prasāda). This is the positive outcome of surrender and devotion. The verse emphasizes that divine grace becomes accessible when one maintains constant remembrance of the Supreme.\n\nThe second half of the verse warns of the consequence of rejecting this divine guidance out of ahaṅkāra (ego or false identification with the limited self). Krishna cautions that if Arjuna refuses to listen due to egoistic notions—perhaps thinking he knows better or can chart his own course independent of divine wisdom—he will face destruction or ruin (vinaṅkṣyasi). This is not a threat but a statement of spiritual law: separation from divine consciousness through ego leads to suffering and spiritual downfall.\n\nThis verse is pivotal in Chapter 18 as it crystallizes the central teaching of the Gita: the choice between ego-driven action and divinely-aligned action. It demonstrates that the path of yoga is not merely philosophical but intensely practical, requiring the surrender of ego and the cultivation of divine remembrance. The verse also highlights the concept of grace (prasāda), showing that spiritual progress is not achieved through individual effort alone but through the combination of sincere practice and divine blessing.",
