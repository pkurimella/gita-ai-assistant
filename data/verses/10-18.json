  "translation": "O Janardana (Krishna), tell me again in detail about Your divine powers and manifestations, for I am never satiated in hearing Your immortal words.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his insatiable desire to hear more about Krishna's divine glories and manifestations. Having heard Krishna's description of His vibhūtis (divine manifestations) in the preceding verses, Arjuna is not satisfied and requests a more elaborate exposition. He addresses Krishna as 'Janārdana' (the one who moves or agitates people), acknowledging Krishna's power to stir the hearts of devotees. Arjuna specifically asks Krishna to describe in greater detail both His yoga (the power by which He pervades and controls the universe) and His vibhūti (His specific divine manifestations in the world).\n\nArjuna's request reveals an important spiritual principle: the words describing the Supreme Lord are compared to amṛta (nectar or immortality). Just as nectar is eternally satisfying yet one never tires of it, so too are the glories of the Divine. This verse demonstrates the nature of true devotion—the more one hears about God, the more one desires to hear. This is in stark contrast to material pleasures which eventually lead to satiation and boredom. Arjuna's eagerness represents the ideal disposition of a spiritual seeker who finds supreme joy in contemplating the infinite nature of the Divine.\n\nThis verse serves as a transition, prompting Krishna to continue His exposition of divine manifestations with even greater detail in the subsequent verses. It also illustrates that spiritual knowledge is not merely intellectual information but a source of deep satisfaction and bliss for the sincere seeker. The inability to be satiated (atṛpti) when hearing about the Lord is considered a sign of genuine devotion and spiritual advancement.",
