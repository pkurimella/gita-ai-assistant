  "transliteration": "āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ |\nīhante kāma-bhogārtham anyāyenārtha-sañcayān ||12||",
  "translation": "Bound by hundreds of cords of hope and expectation, given over to lust and anger, they strive to amass wealth by unjust means for the gratification of their desires.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of those possessed by demoniac qualities (āsurī sampat). Such individuals are trapped in an endless web of desires and expectations (āśā-pāśa), with each fulfilled desire giving birth to countless new ones. The metaphor of being 'bound by hundreds of cords' vividly illustrates how hope and expectation create bondage rather than freedom. These persons are completely dominated by lust (kāma) and anger (krodha), which are identified elsewhere in the Gita as the primary gates to hell.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that such people actively strive (īhante) to accumulate wealth and possessions through unrighteous means (anyāyena). Their sole motivation is the gratification of sensual desires (kāma-bhoga). This stands in stark contrast to the divine qualities described earlier in the chapter, where wealth and action are oriented toward dharma and the welfare of all beings. The unjust accumulation of wealth mentioned here includes exploitation, corruption, dishonesty, and any means that violate ethical principles. This verse serves as a warning about how unchecked desires and the abandonment of dharma lead to a life of perpetual dissatisfaction and moral degradation, binding the soul ever more tightly to material existence.",
