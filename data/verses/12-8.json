  "sanskrit": "मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय।\nनिवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशयः॥",
  "transliteration": "mayy eva mana ādhatsva mayi buddhiṁ niveśaya |\nnivasiṣyasi mayy eva ata ūrdhvaṁ na saṁśayaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Fix your mind on Me alone, let your intellect dwell in Me. Thereafter you shall certainly live in Me alone; of this there is no doubt.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the most direct and supreme path of devotion - complete absorption of mind and intellect in the Divine. He instructs Arjuna to establish his mind (manas) in Him and to place his discriminative faculty (buddhi) entirely in Him. This represents the pinnacle of bhakti yoga, where the devotee's entire consciousness - both the emotional and intellectual aspects - becomes unified with the Supreme.\n\nThe promise Krishna makes is profound: complete assurance of dwelling in the Divine. The phrase 'ata ūrdhvam' (thereafter) indicates that this union is not merely a future attainment after death, but begins immediately upon such total surrender. The devotee who achieves this state of complete mental and intellectual absorption experiences divine consciousness even while living in the body. Krishna's emphatic declaration 'na saṁśayaḥ' (no doubt) removes all uncertainty, providing absolute confidence to the aspirant about the efficacy of this path.\n\nThis verse establishes the ideal standard of devotion in the Bhakti Yoga chapter. While subsequent verses will describe alternative practices for those who find this complete absorption difficult, Krishna first presents this highest form of devotion as the ultimate goal. The verse emphasizes that true bhakti is not mere emotional sentiment but involves the total engagement of one's entire being - mind, intellect, and consciousness - in constant remembrance and contemplation of the Divine.",
