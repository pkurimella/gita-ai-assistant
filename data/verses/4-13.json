  "sanskrit": "चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः।\nतस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम्॥",
  "transliteration": "cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ |\ntasya kartāram api māṁ viddhy akartāram avyayam ||",
  "translation": "The fourfold order of society was created by Me according to the divisions of quality (guna) and action (karma). Though I am the creator of this system, know Me to be the non-doer and immutable.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the divine origin of the social order based on inherent qualities and corresponding actions, not by birth alone. The four varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra) were established according to the predominance of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) in individuals and their natural inclinations toward different types of work. This system was meant to organize society functionally based on individual nature and capacity, ensuring harmonious social functioning.\n\nKrishna then presents a profound paradox: though He is the creator of this system, He remains the non-doer (akartā). This illustrates the principle that the Supreme Being, though the source of all creation and activity, remains unaffected and unchanged by any action. Being avyaya (immutable), Krishna transcends the law of cause and effect that binds ordinary beings. This verse connects to the chapter's central theme of action without attachment—just as God acts without being bound by action, the wise person should perform their duties without ego-identification or attachment to results. The verse establishes that one's dharma should be determined by one's inherent nature and qualities rather than merely by birth, a revolutionary concept that emphasizes merit and natural aptitude over rigid hereditary classification.",
