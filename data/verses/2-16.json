  "translation": "The unreal has no existence, and the real never ceases to be. The truth about both of these has been perceived by the seers of truth.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most profound philosophical statements in the Bhagavad Gita, establishing the fundamental distinction between the real (sat) and the unreal (asat). Krishna explains that what is unreal—the temporary, changing phenomena of the material world including the body—has no permanent existence, while what is real—the eternal Self or Ātman—never ceases to exist. This is the foundational principle of Vedāntic metaphysics.\n\nThe verse directly addresses Arjuna's grief over the potential death of his relatives. Krishna is teaching that the body, being temporary and subject to change, belongs to the category of the unreal (asat), while the soul, being eternal and unchanging, belongs to the real (sat). Birth, death, pleasure, and pain are all modifications of the unreal and therefore cannot affect the essential nature of the Self. This understanding is crucial for Arjuna to transcend his sorrow and confusion.\n\nThe reference to 'tattvadarśibhiḥ' (seers of truth) indicates that this knowledge is not mere speculation but has been realized and verified by enlightened sages throughout time. This verse establishes the epistemological foundation for the entire teaching of the Gita—that true knowledge consists in discriminating between the eternal and the temporary, the Self and the non-Self. This discrimination (viveka) is essential for spiritual liberation and forms the basis of Sāṅkhya philosophy integrated into Krishna's teaching.",
