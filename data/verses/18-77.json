  "commentary": "In this verse, Sanjaya addresses King Dhritarashtra, expressing his profound joy and spiritual exhilaration at having witnessed and narrated the divine dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna. The repetition of 'saṁsmṛtya' (remembering) and 'muhur muhuḥ' (again and again) emphasizes the inexhaustible nature of the spiritual bliss derived from this sacred conversation. Sanjaya, blessed with divine vision by Sage Vyasa, has been the medium through which this timeless wisdom has been transmitted to the blind king and to all of humanity.\n\nThis verse marks the beginning of the conclusion of the Bhagavad Gita, where Sanjaya shares his personal reflections on the extraordinary teaching he has just narrated. The use of 'adbhutam' (wonderful/marvelous) and 'puṇyam' (sacred/holy) indicates that this dialogue is not merely philosophical discourse but a divine revelation that purifies and elevates the consciousness of anyone who hears or remembers it. Sanjaya's repeated joy suggests that each recollection brings fresh insights and deeper understanding, highlighting the multi-layered nature of Krishna's teachings. This verse also serves to remind readers that the Gita itself is a source of continuous spiritual nourishment and transformation.",
