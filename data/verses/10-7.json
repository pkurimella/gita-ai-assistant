  "sanskrit": "एतां विभूतिं योगं च मम यो वेत्ति तत्त्वतः।\nसोऽविकम्पेन योगेन युज्यते नात्र संशयः॥",
  "transliteration": "etāṁ vibhūtiṁ yogaṁ ca mama yo vetti tattvataḥ |\nso'vikampena yogena yujyate nātra saṁśayaḥ ||",
  "translation": "One who truly knows this glory and divine power of Mine becomes established in unshakeable yoga. Of this there is no doubt.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna declares the profound result of understanding His divine manifestations (vibhūti) and His yoga (the power by which He creates and sustains the universe). The word 'tattvataḥ' (in truth or in essence) is crucial—it indicates not merely intellectual knowledge but direct realization of Krishna's supreme nature. This understanding is not theoretical but experiential, leading to a transformation of consciousness.\n\nThe phrase 'avikampena yogena' (unshakeable yoga) describes the state of one who has truly comprehended Krishna's divine nature. Such a person becomes firmly established in union with the Divine, experiencing unwavering devotion and steady spiritual practice. This steadiness arises naturally from the recognition that all powers, all manifestations, and all existence emanate from the Supreme. When one sees Krishna as the source of everything, the mind naturally becomes absorbed in Him without distraction or doubt.\n\nKrishna emphasizes 'nātra saṁśayaḥ' (there is no doubt about this) to underscore the certainty of this spiritual law. This verse serves as a bridge in Chapter 10, connecting the theoretical understanding of God's manifestations with the practical result—unshakeable devotion and yoga. It establishes that true knowledge of the Divine inevitably leads to firm establishment in spiritual practice, making the pursuit of such knowledge not merely academic but transformative and liberating.",
