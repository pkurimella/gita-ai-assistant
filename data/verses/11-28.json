  "translation": "As the many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, so do these heroes of the world of men enter Your blazing mouths.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his description of the terrifying cosmic vision, using a powerful simile to convey the inevitability of death. Just as countless rivers, driven by their natural force, flow inexorably toward the ocean, so too do the great warriors and heroes rush helplessly into the flaming mouths of the Universal Form. This imagery emphasizes the irresistible power of time and destiny as embodied in Krishna's cosmic form.\n\nThe comparison to rivers flowing into the ocean is particularly apt, as it suggests both the natural order of things and the ultimate dissolution of individual identity into the cosmic whole. The warriors, despite their strength and valor in the mortal world, are powerless before the cosmic force of time (Kāla). The blazing mouths represent the destructive aspect of divinity, showing that creation and destruction are both part of the divine play.\n\nThis verse serves to reinforce the central teaching of the Gita regarding the inevitability of death and the futility of Arjuna's reluctance to fight. It demonstrates that the destruction of these warriors is already ordained by cosmic law, and Arjuna is merely an instrument in this divine plan. The vision reveals the ultimate truth that all beings are subject to time and must eventually merge back into the cosmic source from which they emerged.",
