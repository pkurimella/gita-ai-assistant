  "transliteration": "vṛṣṇīnāṁ vāsudevo 'smi pāṇḍavānāṁ dhanañjayaḥ |\nmunīnām apy ahaṁ vyāsaḥ kavīnām uśanā kaviḥ ||10.37||",
  "translation": "Among the Vrishnis, I am Vasudeva (Krishna); among the Pandavas, I am Arjuna the winner of wealth. Among the sages, I am Vyasa; and among the wise poets, I am Ushana (Shukracharya).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate His divine manifestations across various categories of beings. He identifies Himself with the foremost representatives in each group. Among the Vrishni clan (the Yadava dynasty), He is Vasudeva—which is Krishna Himself, the son of Vasudeva. Among the Pandavas, He declares Himself to be Arjuna (Dhananjaya, the conqueror of wealth), which is particularly significant as He is speaking directly to Arjuna, indicating the special relationship and divine connection between them.\n\nKrishna then identifies with Vyasa among the sages—Vyasa being the compiler of the Vedas, author of the Mahabharata, and the very narrator of this Bhagavad Gita through Sanjaya. Among the wise poet-seers (kavis), He is Ushana, also known as Shukracharya, the preceptor of the demons who possessed profound wisdom and poetic ability. This verse is particularly self-referential and intimate, as Krishna mentions both Himself by His earthly name and His dear friend Arjuna, while the entire conversation is contained within Vyasa's composition. It demonstrates that the Supreme manifests most prominently in those who excel in their respective fields through wisdom, virtue, and divine qualities.",
