  "translation": "Just as the ocean remains undisturbed and unchanging even though waters from all sides continuously flow into it, similarly, one into whom all desires enter but who remains steady and unmoved attains peace—not the person who strives to fulfill desires.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most beautiful and profound metaphors in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna compares the person of steady wisdom (sthita-prajña) to the vast ocean that remains full, calm, and unchanged despite countless rivers continuously flowing into it. The ocean neither overflows with the addition of waters nor does it seek more water. Similarly, the self-realized person remains unaffected by desires that may arise in the mind. Such desires come and go, but the wise person maintains inner equilibrium and is not disturbed by their presence or absence.\n\nThe verse draws a sharp contrast between two types of individuals: one who has transcended the compulsion of desires (though desires may still arise) and one who actively pursues the fulfillment of desires (kāma-kāmī). The former achieves lasting peace (śānti) because their happiness is not dependent on external circumstances or the satisfaction of wants. The latter remains perpetually restless, as the fulfillment of one desire inevitably gives rise to another, creating an endless cycle of craving and temporary satisfaction.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Sāṅkhya Yoga chapter's theme of equanimity and self-mastery. Krishna is not advocating for the suppression or violent rejection of desires, but rather the cultivation of an inner state where one is not controlled or disturbed by them. This verse follows the previous descriptions of the sthita-prajña and serves as a culminating image of spiritual maturity—a state of fullness and contentment that is self-sustained and independent of external conditions.",
