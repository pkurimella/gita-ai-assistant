  "sanskrit": "यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम्।\nनायं लोकोऽस्त्ययज्ञस्य कुतोऽन्यः कुरुसत्तम।।",
  "transliteration": "yajña-śiṣṭāmṛta-bhujo yānti brahma sanātanam |\nnāyaṁ loko'sty ayajñasya kuto'nyaḥ kurusattama ||",
  "translation": "Those who partake of the sacred remnants of sacrifice (yajna) attain the eternal Brahman. But for one who does not perform sacrifice, even this world is not happy—how then can the next world be, O best of the Kurus?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the indispensable nature of yajna (sacrifice) for spiritual progress and even worldly well-being. Those who consume the 'nectar' that remains after offering sacrifice to the Divine attain Brahman, the eternal Supreme Reality. This 'nectar' (amrita) refers to the sanctified remnants of offerings, which are purified by being first dedicated to the Divine. Such prasada (sanctified food) nourishes not just the body but the soul, leading one toward ultimate liberation.\n\nKrishna then presents a stark warning: for those who do not perform yajna—who live selfishly without offering their actions to the Divine or serving others—even this present world becomes a source of suffering. If one cannot find peace and fulfillment in this visible world through selfless action, how can one expect happiness in the subtle realms beyond? This verse underscores the universal principle that selfish living leads to bondage and misery, while sacrifice and selfless service create the foundation for both worldly harmony and spiritual liberation. The verse connects to the chapter's broader theme of various forms of yajna as pathways to knowledge and self-realization.",
