  "sanskrit": "बुद्ध्या विशुद्धया युक्तो धृत्यात्मानं नियम्य च।\nशब्दादीन्विषयांस्त्यक्त्वा रागद्वेषौ व्युदस्य च॥",
  "transliteration": "buddhyā viśuddhayā yukto dhṛtyātmānaṃ niyamya ca |\nśabdādīn viṣayāṃs tyaktvā rāga-dveṣau vyudasya ca ||",
  "translation": "Endowed with a purified intellect, controlling the self with firmness, abandoning sound and other sense objects, and casting aside attraction and aversion.",
  "commentary": "This verse begins a series of verses (51-53) that describe the qualifications and practices necessary for attaining Brahman-realization. Krishna outlines the essential prerequisites for one who seeks to establish themselves in the highest knowledge. The purified intellect (viśuddhā buddhi) refers to discrimination that has been cleansed of all impurities like desire, anger, and delusion. Controlling the self with firmness (dhṛtyā) indicates the steadfast determination required to maintain discipline on the spiritual path.\n\nThe verse emphasizes both internal and external renunciation. Internally, one must abandon attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa), the twin forces that bind the soul to the cycle of karma. Externally, one must renounce excessive indulgence in sense objects—sound, touch, form, taste, and smell. This does not necessarily mean complete physical withdrawal, but rather a mental detachment and moderation in sensory engagement. The aspirant learns to use the senses as necessary for bodily maintenance while remaining inwardly free from their pull.\n\nThis verse is crucial in the context of Chapter 18 because it bridges the discussion of the three gunas and karma yoga with the ultimate goal of moksha. It demonstrates that liberation is not merely theoretical knowledge but requires practical discipline, purification of the mind, and systematic withdrawal from the attractions and repulsions that keep consciousness bound to the material realm. These qualities form the foundation upon which the subsequent verses build the complete picture of the liberated sage.",
