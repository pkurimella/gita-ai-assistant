  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his complete acceptance and faith in Krishna's teachings about His divine manifestations. By addressing Krishna as 'Keshava' (the slayer of the demon Keshi), Arjuna acknowledges Krishna's divine power. Arjuna's declaration that he accepts everything as truth (sarvam etad ṛtam) demonstrates his unwavering faith and marks a significant development in his spiritual understanding.\n\nArjuna further emphasizes the transcendental nature of Krishna's reality by stating that even the celestial beings (devas) and the demons (dānavas) cannot fully comprehend His true nature and manifestations. This statement highlights the supreme position of the Divine, which exists beyond the comprehension of all created beings, whether they belong to higher or lower realms. This verse sets the stage for Arjuna's subsequent request for Krishna to describe His divine glories in greater detail, as even though the Supreme cannot be fully known, devotional contemplation of His manifestations aids in spiritual progress.",
