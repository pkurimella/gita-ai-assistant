  "translation": "And whoever, at the time of death, leaves the body remembering Me alone, attains My nature; of this there is no doubt.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most celebrated teachings of the Bhagavad Gita regarding the importance of one's final thoughts at death. Krishna declares with absolute certainty that anyone who departs from the physical body while remembering Him alone will attain His divine nature. The phrase 'nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ' (there is no doubt about this) emphasizes the definitiveness of this spiritual law. This is not mere speculation but a fundamental principle of consciousness and spiritual attainment.\n\nThe verse builds upon the previous discussion about the nature of remembrance at death and its consequences. The critical word 'eva' (alone) indicates exclusive remembrance—not mixed with worldly thoughts or desires. This teaching establishes the supreme importance of cultivating constant remembrance of the Divine throughout life, as the mind's final moment reflects its predominant conditioning. The verse implies that the state of consciousness at death determines one's destination, making spiritual practice during life essential preparation for that crucial moment.\n\nPhilosophically, this verse reveals the principle that consciousness gravitates toward its object of meditation. Just as the previous verse explained that one attains whatever one remembers at death, this verse specifically addresses remembrance of the Supreme. It underscores the accessibility of liberation—regardless of one's past, sincere remembrance of Krishna at the final moment guarantees union with the Divine. This teaching has inspired countless practitioners to develop the discipline of constant remembrance (smaraṇa) as a central spiritual practice.",
