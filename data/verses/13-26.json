  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Distinction between the Field and the Knower of the Field",
  "sanskrit": "अन्ये त्वेवमजानन्तः श्रुत्वान्येभ्य उपासते ।\nते अपि चातितरन्त्येव मृत्युं श्रुतिपरायणाः ॥२६॥",
  "transliteration": "anye tv evam ajānantaḥ śrutvānyebhya upāsate |\nte api cātitaranty eva mṛtyuṁ śruti-parāyaṇāḥ ||26||",
  "translation": "Others, however, not knowing thus, worship having heard from others. They too certainly transcend death, being devoted to what they have heard.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna acknowledges an alternative path to spiritual realization for those who may not have direct knowledge or understanding of the philosophical truths discussed earlier in the chapter. These sincere seekers, though lacking direct comprehension of the distinction between kṣetra (field) and kṣetrajña (knower of the field), can still attain liberation through faithful devotion to the teachings they receive from authentic sources.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of śravaṇa (hearing) and śraddhā (faith) in the spiritual journey. Even those who cannot intellectually grasp the profound metaphysical distinctions can progress spiritually by faithfully following the guidance of realized teachers and sacred scriptures. Their devotion to what they have heard (śruti-parāyaṇāḥ) becomes their means of transcending death and the cycle of rebirth. This demonstrates Krishna's inclusive approach, recognizing that different temperaments and capacities require different paths, yet all can lead to the same ultimate goal of liberation when pursued with sincerity and dedication.",
