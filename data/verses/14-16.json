  "sanskrit": "कर्मणः सुकृतस्याहुः सात्त्विकं निर्मलं फलम् ।\nरजसस्तु फलं दुःखमज्ञानं तमसः फलम् ॥१६॥",
  "transliteration": "karmaṇaḥ sukṛtasyāhuḥ sāttvikaṁ nirmalaṁ phalam |\nrajasastu phalaṁ duḥkham ajñānaṁ tamasaḥ phalam ||16||",
  "translation": "The fruit of good action, they say, is sattvic and pure; the fruit of rajasic action is pain; and the fruit of tamasic action is ignorance.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the distinct fruits or consequences that arise from actions performed under the influence of each of the three gunas. Actions performed in sattva guna yield pure, beneficial results that lead to knowledge, happiness, and spiritual elevation. These are characterized as nirmala (spotless, untainted), bringing clarity and peace to the doer. Actions motivated by rajas produce suffering and restlessness as their fruit, because they are driven by desire, attachment, and the constant craving for results, leading to disappointment and agitation when expectations are not met.\n\nThe most detrimental are actions performed under the influence of tamas, which result in ignorance (ajñāna). Such actions cloud the intellect, deepen delusion, and bind the soul further in darkness and confusion. This verse establishes a clear karmic principle: the quality of our actions determines the quality of their results. Krishna is teaching Arjuna that understanding this relationship is crucial for spiritual progress. By consciously cultivating sattvic actions and minimizing rajasic and tamasic tendencies, one can gradually purify the mind and advance toward liberation. This verse connects directly to the chapter's theme of understanding how the three gunas operate in all aspects of life, including the fruits of our actions.",
