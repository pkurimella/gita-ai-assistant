  "sanskrit": "रजो रागात्मकं विद्धि तृष्णासङ्गसमुद्भवम्।\nतन्निबध्नाति कौन्तेय कर्मसङ्गेन देहिनम्॥",
  "transliteration": "rajo rāgātmakaṁ viddhi tṛṣṇā-saṅga-samudbhavam |\ntannibadhnāti kaunteya karma-saṅgena dehinam ||",
  "translation": "Know that rajas is of the nature of passion, born of craving and attachment. O son of Kunti, it binds the embodied soul through attachment to action.",
  "commentary": "After describing the binding nature of sattva guna in the previous verse, Krishna now explains the characteristics and effects of rajas, the second of the three gunas. Rajas is identified as being of the nature of passion (rāgātmaka), arising from intense craving (tṛṣṇā) and attachment (saṅga). This guna is characterized by restlessness, desire, and the constant urge for activity and acquisition. Unlike sattva which binds through attachment to happiness and knowledge, rajas binds the soul through attachment to action itself and its fruits.\n\nThe binding mechanism of rajas is particularly insidious because it creates an endless cycle of desire and action. The individual under the influence of rajas is constantly driven to act, not out of duty or wisdom, but from craving for results, recognition, pleasure, or power. This creates karma-saṅga (attachment to action), which keeps the soul bound to the cycle of birth and death. The rajasic person is never at peace, always seeking the next achievement, the next pleasure, the next acquisition. This verse is crucial in understanding why mere activity, even seemingly productive activity, can be a form of bondage if performed with attachment and desire for personal gain rather than as selfless service or duty.",
