  "transliteration": "kṛṣi-gau-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam |\nparicaryātmakaṁ karma śūdrasyāpi svabhāva-jam ||44||",
  "translation": "Agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade are the natural duties of the Vaishya born of his own nature. Work of a service nature is the natural duty of the Shudra, also born of his own nature.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's exposition of the four-fold division of society (varna) based on inherent qualities (gunas) and natural inclinations (svabhava). Here, Krishna describes the natural duties of the Vaishya and Shudra classes. The Vaishya's dharma involves productive economic activities—agriculture (kṛṣi), protection and rearing of cattle (gau-rakṣya), and commerce or trade (vāṇijya). These activities sustain society materially and represent the application of rajas guna with some sattva, focused on creation and distribution of wealth.\n\nThe Shudra's natural duty is described as paricaryātmaka karma—work of service nature. This involves supporting the other three varnas through various forms of assistance and labor. Krishna emphasizes that these duties arise from svabhava (one's own nature), not from external imposition. The key teaching is that each person should perform duties aligned with their natural temperament and abilities. When one works according to one's svabhava, the work becomes a means of spiritual evolution rather than bondage. This verse, along with the previous ones, establishes that spiritual perfection is attainable through any occupation when performed with dedication and as an offering to the Divine, which Krishna will elaborate in the following verses.",
