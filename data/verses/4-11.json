  "transliteration": "ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham |\nmama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ ||11||",
  "translation": "In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate with them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pritha (Arjuna).",
  "commentary": "This verse reveals a profound principle of divine reciprocity and universal spiritual truth. Krishna declares that He responds to devotees in exact proportion to how they approach Him. This demonstrates both the impartiality and the personal nature of the Divine - God meets each seeker at their level of understanding and devotion, whether they worship with form or formlessness, with love or knowledge, with rituals or meditation. The Lord's grace is not arbitrary but responsive to human effort and sincerity.\n\nThe second line establishes that all spiritual paths ultimately lead to the same Divine reality. Whether consciously or unconsciously, knowingly or unknowingly, all beings are following the path established by the Supreme. This verse validates the diversity of spiritual approaches while affirming the unity of the ultimate goal. It provides theological foundation for religious pluralism and tolerance, suggesting that different spiritual traditions are various ways of approaching the same ultimate truth.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 4, which discusses divine incarnation and the yoga of knowledge, this verse emphasizes that the Lord's avatāra serves all seekers according to their needs. It reassures Arjuna that whatever path one takes with sincerity - whether karma yoga, jnana yoga, or bhakti yoga - will be honored by the Divine. This teaching removes spiritual anxiety and encourages authentic practice according to one's nature and capacity.",
