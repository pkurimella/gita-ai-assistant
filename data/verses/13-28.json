  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Distinction between the Field and the Knower of the Field",
  "sanskrit": "समं सर्वेषु भूतेषु तिष्ठन्तं परमेश्वरम्।\nविनश्यत्स्वविनश्यन्तं यः पश्यति स पश्यति॥",
  "transliteration": "samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram |\nvinaśyatsv avinaśyantaṁ yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati ||",
  "translation": "One who sees the Supreme Lord dwelling equally in all beings, the imperishable within the perishable—such a person truly sees.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the hallmark of true spiritual vision. The person who perceives the Supreme Lord (Parameshwara) present equally in all beings—whether in a saint or a sinner, in a human or an animal, in the exalted or the lowly—is the one who truly sees reality. This equal vision (sama-darshana) transcends superficial differences and recognizes the one divine presence pervading all existence.\n\nThe verse emphasizes a profound paradox: while all physical bodies and material forms are subject to destruction (vinashyatsu), the Supreme Self dwelling within them remains eternally imperishable (avinashyantam). This distinction between the perishable field (kshetra) and the imperishable knower (kshetrajna) is central to the entire chapter. Those who can perceive this unchanging divine essence amidst the constantly changing world of names and forms have attained true knowledge.\n\nThis teaching has practical implications for spiritual practice. When one develops this equal vision, discrimination and prejudice naturally fall away, replaced by universal compassion and reverence for all life. This verse thus connects the metaphysical understanding of the field and its knower with the ethical imperative of seeing divinity in all beings, which is the foundation of true wisdom and liberation.",
