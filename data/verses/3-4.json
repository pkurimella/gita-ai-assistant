  "sanskrit": "न कर्मणामनारम्भान्नैष्कर्म्यं पुरुषोऽश्नुते।\nन च संन्यसनादेव सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति॥",
  "transliteration": "na karmaṇām anārambhān naiṣkarmyaṁ puruṣo 'śnute |\nna ca sannyasanād eva siddhiṁ samadhigacchati ||",
  "translation": "Not by merely abstaining from action does one attain freedom from action, nor by renunciation alone does one attain perfection.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a common misconception about spiritual life—that simply avoiding action or externally renouncing duties leads to liberation. He clarifies that naiṣkarmya (freedom from the bondage of action) cannot be achieved merely by non-performance of actions (anārambha). True freedom comes not from inaction but from performing action without attachment to results. Similarly, mere external renunciation (sannyāsa) without inner purification and wisdom does not lead to siddhi (spiritual perfection).\n\nThis teaching is crucial in the context of Arjuna's dilemma. Arjuna is contemplating abandoning his duty as a warrior, thinking that renunciation of action is a higher path. Krishna systematically dismantles this notion by explaining that what matters is not whether one acts or renounces, but the spirit and understanding with which one engages with action. The verse emphasizes that spiritual perfection requires engaged action performed with the right attitude—detachment, selflessness, and dedication to dharma—rather than mere physical withdrawal from duties.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in Krishna's integration of action and renunciation. He is preparing the ground for karma yoga, where action itself becomes a means of liberation when performed without ego and attachment. This verse establishes that the path to freedom is not through escapism but through transformation of one's relationship with action, making it a cornerstone teaching for householders and active individuals seeking spiritual growth.",
