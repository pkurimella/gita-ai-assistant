  "transliteration": "brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati |\nsamaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṃ labhate parām ||",
  "translation": "One who is established in Brahman, with a serene mind, neither grieves nor desires. Being equal-minded toward all beings, such a person attains supreme devotion to Me.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of one who has attained self-realization and become established in Brahman-consciousness (brahma-bhūtaḥ). Such a person experiences complete inner tranquility (prasannātmā) and transcends the dualities of grief and desire. They neither lament over the past nor crave for future gains, having realized the eternal nature of the Self. This equanimity extends to all beings, seeing the same divine essence in everyone.\n\nKrishna reveals a profound truth here: self-realization is not the final goal but rather the foundation for parā-bhakti (supreme devotion). When one realizes their identity with Brahman and sees all beings equally, they naturally develop the highest form of devotion to the Supreme. This verse bridges jñāna (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion), showing that true knowledge culminates in pure love for God. The state of brahma-bhūtaḥ removes all obstacles to devotion—ego, attachment, and discrimination—allowing divine love to flow spontaneously.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant in Chapter 18's synthesis of all yogas. It demonstrates that liberation (mokṣa) through knowledge and supreme devotion are not contradictory paths but complementary aspects of spiritual perfection. The verse establishes that one who has transcended material consciousness through self-knowledge becomes qualified for the highest devotional relationship with the Divine, which Krishna will elaborate upon in subsequent verses.",
