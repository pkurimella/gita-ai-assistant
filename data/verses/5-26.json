  "sanskrit": "कामक्रोधवियुक्तानां यतीनां यतचेतसाम् ।\nअभितो ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते विदितात्मनाम् ॥२६॥",
  "transliteration": "kāma-krodha-viyuktānāṁ yatīnāṁ yata-cetasām |\nabhito brahma-nirvāṇaṁ vartate viditātmanām ||26||",
  "translation": "For those self-controlled sages who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their minds and have realized the Self, liberation in Brahman exists both here and hereafter.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of those who have attained the highest spiritual realization. Krishna emphasizes that liberation (brahma-nirvāṇa) is not merely a post-mortem state but is available 'abhitaḥ' - on all sides, meaning both in this life and beyond. The verse outlines the qualifications for such liberated beings: freedom from desire (kāma) and anger (krodha), control over the mind (yata-cetasām), and direct knowledge of the Self (viditātmanām).\n\nThe term 'yatīnāṁ' refers to those who strive earnestly on the spiritual path, particularly sannyāsins or renunciates. However, the verse's emphasis is not on external renunciation alone but on internal purification. The dual enemies of spiritual progress - desire and anger - must be transcended. These are considered the primary obstacles because desire leads to attachment and anger arises from frustrated desires. When these are eliminated and the mind is brought under control, the aspirant comes to know the true nature of the Self.\n\nThis verse is significant within Chapter 5 as it presents the culmination of karma-sannyāsa yoga. It shows that whether one follows the path of action or renunciation, the ultimate goal is the same: brahma-nirvāṇa, complete absorption in Brahman. The verse assures seekers that liberation is not a distant, uncertain goal but a present reality for those who have purified themselves and realized their true nature. This teaching bridges the discussion of karma yoga with the meditation practices that follow in subsequent verses.",
