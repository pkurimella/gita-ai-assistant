  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nyo'yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ sāmyena madhusūdana |\netasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Madhusudana (Krishna), this yoga of equanimity that You have described—I do not see how it can have a stable foundation, due to the restlessness of the mind.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his honest doubt about the practical feasibility of the meditation yoga that Krishna has been teaching. After hearing Krishna's detailed instructions on dhyana yoga, which requires perfect mental equilibrium (samya) and steadiness, Arjuna voices the concern that troubles most spiritual aspirants: the inherent restlessness and instability of the mind. He addresses Krishna as Madhusudana (slayer of the demon Madhu), perhaps subtly suggesting that controlling the mind is as difficult as slaying a powerful demon.\n\nArjuna's objection is significant because it represents the universal human experience of mental turbulence. Despite understanding the theoretical beauty and value of meditation, he questions whether such a practice can have a 'sthiram sthitim' (stable foundation or steady state) given the 'chanchalatvat' (fickleness) of the mind. This verse marks a crucial transition in the chapter where the teaching moves from instruction to addressing practical obstacles. Arjuna's doubt is not born of disrespect but of genuine concern about implementation, making him an ideal student who seeks clarity rather than blindly accepting teachings. His question sets up Krishna's subsequent explanation about the nature of the mind and the methods to control it, which forms one of the most practical and psychologically profound sections of the Gita.",
