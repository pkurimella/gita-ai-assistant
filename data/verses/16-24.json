  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 16 provides the practical guidance following the exposition of divine and demoniac qualities. After describing the destructive nature of demoniac tendencies and the liberating qualities of divine nature, Krishna establishes the scriptures (śāstra) as the authoritative guide for discriminating between right and wrong action. The scriptures serve as the objective standard that prevents individuals from being swayed by their lower impulses, desires, or ego-driven motivations that characterize the demoniac nature.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that one should first understand (jñātvā) the scriptural injunctions and then act accordingly. This verse bridges the theoretical knowledge of divine and demoniac qualities with practical application. The scriptures provide a framework that helps aspirants cultivate divine qualities while avoiding demoniac tendencies. By following scriptural guidelines, one ensures that actions are aligned with dharma rather than being motivated by lust, anger, and greed—the three gates to hell mentioned earlier in this chapter.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant as it establishes the importance of śāstra-pramāṇa (scriptural authority) in spiritual life. It suggests that personal whims, social conventions, or individual reasoning alone are insufficient guides for spiritual progress. The scriptures, being the distilled wisdom of realized sages, provide the roadmap for cultivating divine qualities and ultimately attaining liberation. This teaching prepares the ground for the next chapter's discussion on the three types of faith and their relationship to scriptural injunctions.",
