  "commentary": "This verse provides essential instructions for the practice of meditation. Krishna prescribes that the practitioner should constantly (satatam) practice focusing the mind on the Self. The emphasis on 'rahasi sthitaḥ' (remaining in seclusion) indicates the need for a quiet, undisturbed environment conducive to inward contemplation. The word 'ekākī' (alone) suggests both physical solitude and mental singularity of purpose, where the practitioner is not distracted by external company or internal fragmentation of attention.\n\nThe qualifications mentioned—yata-cittātmā (controlled mind and body), nirāśīḥ (free from desires), and aparigrahaḥ (without possessions or acquisitiveness)—are prerequisites for successful meditation. These conditions create the mental purity and stability necessary for deep contemplation. The absence of desires and the non-accumulation of possessions prevent the mind from being pulled outward toward objects of sense gratification. This verse establishes the foundational discipline required for the meditative practices that Krishna will describe in greater detail in the following verses, emphasizing that meditation is not merely a technique but requires a comprehensive lifestyle of simplicity, self-control, and renunciation of worldly entanglements.",
