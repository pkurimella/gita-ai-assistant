  "sanskrit": "नात्यश्नतस्तु योगोऽस्ति न चैकान्तमनश्नतः ।\nन चातिस्वप्नशीलस्य जाग्रतो नैव चार्जुन ॥१६॥",

  "translation": "Yoga is not for one who eats too much, nor for one who does not eat at all; nor for one who sleeps too much, nor for one who keeps awake excessively, O Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the principle of moderation as essential for the practice of yoga and meditation. He warns against extremes in eating, sleeping, and waking, as such imbalances create obstacles on the spiritual path. One who overindulges in food becomes lethargic and dull, making meditation difficult, while one who fasts excessively weakens the body and mind. Similarly, excessive sleep leads to tamasic tendencies and mental dullness, while insufficient sleep causes restlessness and inability to concentrate.\n\nThis teaching reflects the Buddha's concept of the Middle Way and is fundamental to Krishna's practical approach to spirituality. The verse underscores that yoga is not about extreme asceticism or self-mortification, but about finding balance in all aspects of life. The body and mind must be maintained in a healthy, balanced state to serve as proper instruments for spiritual practice. This moderation applies not only to physical needs but extends to all activities and behaviors in life.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in Krishna's rejection of extreme practices that were common among certain ascetic traditions of ancient India. He advocates for a sustainable, balanced approach that recognizes the interconnection between physical health and spiritual progress. This verse establishes that true yoga requires wisdom in managing one's daily life, making spiritual practice accessible and practical rather than reserved only for extreme renunciates.",
