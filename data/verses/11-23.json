  "sanskrit": "रूपं महत्ते बहुवक्त्रनेत्रं महाबाहो बहुबाहूरुपादम्।\nबहूदरं बहुदंष्ट्राकरालं दृष्ट्वा लोकाः प्रव्यथितास्तथाहम्॥",
  "transliteration": "rūpaṁ mahat te bahu-vaktra-netraṁ mahā-bāho bahu-bāhūru-pādam |\nbahūdaraṁ bahu-daṁṣṭrā-karālaṁ dṛṣṭvā lokāḥ pravyathitās tathāham ||",
  "translation": "O mighty-armed one, seeing Your great form with many mouths and eyes, with many arms, thighs and feet, with many bellies, and fearsome with many tusks, the worlds are terrified, and so am I.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna describes his overwhelming reaction to the cosmic form (Vishvarupa) of Krishna. He addresses Krishna as 'mighty-armed' (mahā-bāho) while simultaneously being terrified by the infinite manifestation before him. The verse catalogues the multiplicity of the divine form—countless mouths, eyes, arms, thighs, feet, and bellies—all appearing simultaneously in a manner that transcends normal human comprehension. The word 'karāla' (fearsome/terrible) particularly emphasizes the terrifying aspect of this vision, with its many tusks creating a formidable appearance.\n\nArjuna's confession that not only he but all the worlds (lokāḥ) are terrified reveals the universal impact of this divine revelation. This is not merely a personal experience but a cosmic event that affects all levels of existence. The vision has moved beyond the beautiful and awe-inspiring to the terrifying and overwhelming. This reaction is significant in the spiritual journey, as it represents the soul's encounter with the absolute reality that is beyond all comfortable, anthropomorphic conceptions of divinity.\n\nThis verse marks a crucial turning point in Chapter 11, where Arjuna's initial wonder and devotion begin to transform into fear and distress. The philosophical significance lies in understanding that the ultimate reality encompasses both the beautiful and the terrible, the creative and the destructive. This comprehensive vision of divinity challenges limited human perspectives and prepares Arjuna (and the spiritual seeker) for a more complete understanding of the divine nature that transcends dualistic categories of good and evil, pleasant and unpleasant.",
