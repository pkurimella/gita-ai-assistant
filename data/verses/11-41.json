  "sanskrit": "सखेति मत्वा प्रसभं यदुक्तं हे कृष्ण हे यादव हे सखेति ।\nअजानता महिमानं तवेदं मया प्रमादात्प्रणयेन वापि ॥",
  "transliteration": "sakheti matvā prasabhaṁ yad uktaṁ he kṛṣṇa he yādava he sakheti |\najānatā mahimānaṁ tavedaṁ mayā pramādāt praṇayena vāpi ||",
  "translation": "Whatever I have said presumptuously, thinking of You merely as a friend, addressing You as 'O Krishna, O Yadava, O friend,' not knowing this greatness of Yours—through negligence or even through affection.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna begins his heartfelt apology to Krishna after witnessing the awe-inspiring Universal Form (Vishvarupa). Having seen the cosmic reality of Krishna as the Supreme Lord of all existence, Arjuna now realizes how casually and familiarly he had been treating Krishna all along. He acknowledges that he had addressed Krishna informally as a friend and companion, calling Him by familiar names like 'Krishna' and 'Yadava,' completely unaware of His divine majesty and infinite greatness.\n\nArjuna attributes his previous casual behavior to two possible causes: pramāda (negligence or carelessness) and praṇaya (affection or love). The negligence refers to his ignorance of Krishna's true divine nature, while the affection points to the intimate friendship they shared. This verse reveals the profound transformation in Arjuna's consciousness—from seeing Krishna as merely a charioteer and friend to recognizing Him as the Supreme Reality. It also demonstrates the appropriate response of a devotee upon realizing the true nature of the Divine: humility, reverence, and a sense of one's own limitations in comprehending the Absolute.",
