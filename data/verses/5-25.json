  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics and attainment of enlightened sages (rishis) who have achieved Brahma-nirvana, the ultimate liberation in Brahman. Krishna outlines four essential qualities of such realized souls: they are free from all impurities and sins (kshina-kalmashah), meaning their past karmic impressions have been completely exhausted through knowledge and practice; their doubts have been severed (chinna-dvaidha), indicating they have transcended all dualistic thinking and uncertainty about the nature of reality; they have complete self-control (yatatmanah), with their minds firmly established in the Self; and they are devoted to the welfare of all beings (sarva-bhuta-hite ratah), naturally expressing compassion and service to all life.\n\nThis verse is significant within Chapter 5 as it presents the culmination of the path of Karma Yoga combined with knowledge. It demonstrates that true renunciation is not merely external withdrawal but an internal state characterized by purity, clarity, self-mastery, and universal compassion. The emphasis on being engaged in the welfare of all beings shows that genuine spiritual realization does not lead to isolation but to active benevolence. These sages have transcended the ego-driven motivation for action while remaining engaged in selfless service. The attainment of Brahma-nirvana represents the complete dissolution of the individual sense of separation and the realization of one's identity with the Supreme Reality, which is the ultimate goal of all yogic paths described in the Gita.",
