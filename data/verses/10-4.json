  "commentary": "This verse begins an enumeration that continues into the next verse, listing various mental states, virtues, and conditions of existence that all originate from Krishna as the Supreme Lord. The verse presents pairs of opposites (dvandvas) such as pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear and fearlessness, demonstrating that both positive and negative experiences in human life emanate from the Divine source. The virtues mentioned—intellect (buddhi), knowledge (jñāna), freedom from delusion (asammohah), forgiveness (kṣamā), truthfulness (satya), sense control (dama), and mind control (śama)—represent essential qualities for spiritual advancement.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 10, where Krishna reveals His divine manifestations (vibhūtis), this verse establishes that not only the grand cosmic phenomena but also the subtle psychological and moral qualities of beings originate from Him. This teaching emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of the Divine, which is the source of both the dualities experienced in the material world and the transcendent virtues that lead to liberation. By understanding that all these qualities come from Krishna, the devotee develops a comprehensive vision of the Divine presence in every aspect of existence, both internal and external.",
