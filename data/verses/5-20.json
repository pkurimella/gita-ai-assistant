  "sanskrit": "न प्रहृष्येत्प्रियं प्राप्य नोद्विजेत्प्राप्य चाप्रियम्।\nस्थिरबुद्धिरसम्मूढो ब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मणि स्थितः।।",
  "transliteration": "na prahṛṣyet priyaṁ prāpya nodvijet prāpya cāpriyam |\nsthira-buddhir asammūḍho brahma-vid brahmaṇi sthitaḥ ||",
  "translation": "One who neither rejoices upon obtaining what is pleasant nor grieves upon obtaining what is unpleasant, who is steady in intellect, undeluded, a knower of Brahman, and established in Brahman—such a person attains supreme peace.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of a self-realized soul who has transcended the dualities of pleasure and pain. Such a person maintains perfect equanimity in all circumstances, whether favorable or unfavorable. The phrase 'sthira-buddhiḥ' (steady intellect) indicates unwavering wisdom that is not disturbed by external circumstances. Being 'asammūḍhaḥ' (undeluded), such a person sees through the illusory nature of worldly experiences and remains anchored in the eternal truth.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two key aspects of spiritual realization: being a 'brahma-vid' (knower of Brahman) and being 'brahmaṇi sthitaḥ' (established in Brahman). Mere intellectual knowledge of Brahman is insufficient; one must be firmly established in that consciousness. This establishment in Brahman-consciousness is the culmination of karma yoga practice discussed throughout this chapter. When one performs actions without attachment and with awareness of the Self, the mind naturally becomes steady and unaffected by results.\n\nThis verse serves as a benchmark for spiritual progress in the path of karma-sannyasa yoga. It shows that true renunciation is not merely external abandonment of action, but an internal state of consciousness where one remains unshaken by the pairs of opposites. Such a person has transcended the ego-identification and dwells in the eternal, unchanging reality of Brahman, experiencing lasting peace that worldly circumstances cannot disturb.",
