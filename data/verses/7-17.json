  "translation": "Of these, the wise one who is ever steadfast and devoted to the One alone is the best. For I am exceedingly dear to the wise, and he is dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna distinguishes the jñānī (the wise devotee) as supreme among the four types of devotees mentioned in the previous verse. The jñānī is characterized by being nityayukta (ever-united) and ekabhakti (devoted to the One alone), indicating constant, unwavering devotion born of true knowledge. This devotee recognizes Krishna as the Supreme Reality and maintains unbroken communion with Him.\n\nKrishna declares a unique mutual relationship with the jñānī - expressing that He is extremely dear (atyartham priya) to the wise one, and reciprocally, the wise devotee is dear to Him. This reciprocal love represents the highest form of devotion where knowledge and bhakti merge completely. The jñānī sees no distinction between himself and Krishna, understanding the non-dual nature of reality while maintaining devotional love.\n\nThis verse establishes the superiority of jñāna-bhakti (devotion combined with wisdom) over other forms of worship. While all four types of devotees are noble, the jñānī transcends personal desires and distress, worshipping Krishna not for any gain but out of pure love and understanding of His true nature. This represents the culmination of spiritual evolution where the devotee and the Divine exist in perfect harmony and mutual affection.",
