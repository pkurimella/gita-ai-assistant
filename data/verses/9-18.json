  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna enumerates eleven aspects of His divine nature, revealing His all-encompassing relationship with creation and all beings. He declares Himself as the ultimate goal (gati) toward which all spiritual aspirants move, the sustainer (bhartā) who maintains all existence, the supreme Lord (prabhu) who governs all, and the eternal witness (sākṣī) who observes all actions. He is both the dwelling place (nivāsa) of all beings and their ultimate refuge (śaraṇa), as well as the true friend (suhṛt) who seeks the welfare of all without selfish motive.\n\nKrishna further describes Himself as the source of creation (prabhava) and dissolution (pralaya), indicating His role in the cosmic cycles of manifestation and withdrawal. He is the foundation (sthāna) upon which everything rests, the treasure house (nidhāna) where all potentialities are stored, and the imperishable seed (bījam avyayam) from which all existence springs forth repeatedly. This verse emphasizes the complete dependence of all creation upon the Divine, establishing that Krishna is not merely a deity among many, but the absolute reality that encompasses all aspects of existence—temporal and eternal, manifest and unmanifest. This comprehensive description reinforces the central teaching of Chapter 9 regarding the supreme knowledge of God's all-pervasive nature.",
