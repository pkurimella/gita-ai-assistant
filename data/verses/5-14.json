  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Renunciation of Action",
  "sanskrit": "न कर्तृत्वं न कर्माणि लोकस्य सृजति प्रभुः ।\nन कर्मफलसंयोगं स्वभावस्तु प्रवर्तते ॥१४॥",
  "transliteration": "na kartṛtvaṁ na karmāṇi lokasya sṛjati prabhuḥ |\nna karma-phala-saṁyogaṁ svabhāvas tu pravartate ||14||",
  "translation": "The Lord (the embodied Self) creates neither agency nor actions for the world, nor does it create the union with the fruits of actions. It is nature (svabhava) alone that operates.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna clarifies the true nature of the Self (Atman) and its relationship to action. The term 'prabhu' (Lord) here refers to the indwelling Self, not the Supreme Lord. Krishna explains that the pure Self does not create the sense of doership (kartṛtva), does not generate actions (karmāṇi), and does not establish the connection between actions and their fruits. These three aspects—the sense of being a doer, the performance of actions, and the experience of results—all belong to the realm of prakṛti (nature) and not to the eternal Self.\n\nThis verse addresses a fundamental question in Vedantic philosophy: who is the real actor? Krishna reveals that it is svabhava (one's inherent nature, composed of the three guṇas) that drives all activity. The Self remains ever untouched, like the sun that illuminates but is not affected by what it illuminates. This understanding is crucial for karma yoga, as it allows one to act without attachment, recognizing that the true Self is beyond all action. The verse supports the chapter's theme of renunciation in action—not physical abandonment of duties, but the internal renunciation of the false identification with doership. When one realizes that actions occur through the interplay of the guṇas of prakṛti while the Self remains the witness, true freedom is attained even while engaged in worldly activities.",
