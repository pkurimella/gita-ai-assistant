  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna presents a hypothetical scenario to emphasize the importance of His own engagement in action. He explains that if He were to cease performing actions, humanity would follow His example and also abandon their duties. This verse is part of Krishna's argument for why even the Supreme Being, who has nothing to gain and no unfulfilled desires, continues to perform actions.\n\nThe verse establishes the principle of leadership by example. Krishna, as the Supreme Lord who has already attained everything and needs nothing, still performs actions diligently and without laziness (atandritaḥ). This is because great souls and divine beings serve as role models for humanity. People naturally emulate those they consider superior or divine. If Krishna were to become inactive, ordinary people would justify their own inaction by pointing to His example, leading to social chaos and spiritual decline.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 3's central theme of Karma Yoga. Krishna is building His argument that Arjuna, as a leader and warrior, must perform his prescribed duties not only for his own spiritual progress but also to set the right example for society. The verse underscores that those in positions of influence have a greater responsibility to act righteously, as their behavior shapes the conduct of others.",
