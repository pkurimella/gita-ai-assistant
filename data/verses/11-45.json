  "sanskrit": "अदृष्टपूर्वं हृषितोऽस्मि दृष्ट्वा भयेन च प्रव्यथितं मनो मे।\nतदेव मे दर्शय देव रूपं प्रसीद देवेश जगन्निवास।।",
  "transliteration": "adṛṣṭa-pūrvaṁ hṛṣito 'smi dṛṣṭvā bhayena ca pravyathitaṁ mano me |\ntad eva me darśaya deva rūpaṁ prasīda deveśa jagan-nivāsa ||",
  "translation": "Having seen what has never been seen before, I am thrilled, yet my mind is disturbed with fear. O Lord of gods, O abode of the universe, please show me that same four-armed form; be gracious, O Supreme Lord.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his mixed emotions after witnessing Krishna's cosmic form. He acknowledges feeling both exhilarated (hṛṣita) at having witnessed something unprecedented and terrified (bhayena pravyathita) by its overwhelming magnificence. The vision of the universal form, with its countless mouths, eyes, and divine weapons, and the sight of warriors being consumed, has shaken Arjuna to his core. Though spiritually significant, the experience has become too intense for him to bear.\n\nArjuna now requests Krishna to return to a more familiar divine form—specifically the four-armed form of Vishnu (catur-bhuja), which is majestic yet more comprehensible to the human mind. He addresses Krishna with reverent epithets: 'Deveśa' (Lord of gods) and 'Jagan-nivāsa' (abode of the universe), acknowledging the divine nature he has just witnessed while pleading for mercy. This verse illustrates an important spiritual principle: while the ultimate reality is vast and all-encompassing, devotees often need a more personal, accessible form of the Divine to maintain their relationship with God.\n\nThis moment represents a turning point in the chapter, where the overwhelming theophany begins to conclude. Arjuna's request demonstrates that even the most profound spiritual experiences must be balanced with what the human psyche can integrate and sustain. The verse teaches that divine grace manifests not only in revelation but also in the compassionate accommodation of human limitations.",
