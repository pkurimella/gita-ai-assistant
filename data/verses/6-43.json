  "translation": "There he regains the knowledge and wisdom acquired in his previous birth, and strives once again with greater determination towards perfection, O descendant of Kuru.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the continuity of spiritual progress across lifetimes. When a fallen yogi takes birth in favorable circumstances (as described in the previous verses), he automatically regains the spiritual impressions and wisdom cultivated in his previous life. This buddhi-saṁyoga (union with intelligence or wisdom) is not something new that must be learned from scratch, but rather a revival of dormant spiritual knowledge. The term paurva-dehika (from the previous body) emphasizes that spiritual advancement is never lost; it remains as subtle impressions (saṁskāras) that resurface in the new life.\n\nThe verse provides great encouragement to spiritual aspirants by assuring them that no sincere effort on the spiritual path goes to waste. Even if one falls short of complete realization in this lifetime, the accumulated merit and wisdom carry forward. In the new birth, the individual naturally feels drawn to spiritual practices and, with the advantage of previous experience, strives with even greater vigor (bhūyaḥ yatate) toward complete perfection (saṁsiddhi). This teaching removes the fear of failure and inspires practitioners to pursue the spiritual path with confidence, knowing that every step forward is permanently secured in their evolutionary journey toward Self-realization.",
