  "translation": "The senses are said to be superior (to the gross body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; and that which is superior to the intellect is He—the Self.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a hierarchical structure of human consciousness and existence, establishing the supremacy of the Self (Atman) over all other faculties. Krishna describes an ascending order: the physical body is controlled by the senses, the senses are governed by the mind, the mind is directed by the intellect (buddhi), and transcending all of these is the eternal Self. This hierarchy is crucial for understanding how desire and attachment operate—they begin at the sensory level and can overwhelm the mind if not checked by discriminative intellect.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 3, which deals with Karma Yoga, this verse provides the philosophical foundation for self-mastery and the control of desires. Krishna is explaining to Arjuna that desire (kama), which he identified as the great enemy in the previous verses, can only be conquered by understanding this hierarchy and establishing oneself in the highest reality—the Self. By recognizing that one's true nature transcends the mind, intellect, and senses, a spiritual aspirant can gain the strength to overcome sensory temptations and perform duty without attachment. This teaching is essential for the practice of Karma Yoga, as it enables the practitioner to act from a place of inner stability rather than being driven by fluctuating desires and mental impulses.",
