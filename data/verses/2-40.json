  "translation": "In this path there is no loss of effort, nor is there any adverse effect. Even a little practice of this dharma protects one from great fear.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial transition in Krishna's teaching as he introduces the path of Karma Yoga. Krishna assures Arjuna that unlike material endeavors where incomplete efforts often result in total loss, spiritual practice on this path is never wasted. Every step taken toward self-realization is permanently registered and carries forward, even across lifetimes. There is no pratyavāya (contrary result or sin) in this practice—one cannot fail or fall backward spiritually by engaging in this yoga.\n\nThe profound assurance given here addresses a fundamental human concern about the efficacy and safety of spiritual practice. Krishna emphasizes that even the smallest effort (svalpam api) in practicing this dharma yields protective benefits, saving one from mahato bhayāt—the great fear of saṃsāra, birth, death, and suffering. This is particularly relevant to Arjuna's situation, as he stands paralyzed by fear and confusion on the battlefield. The verse serves as an encouragement that any step toward righteous action and spiritual understanding is valuable and cumulative.\n\nThis teaching establishes an important principle that distinguishes spiritual practice from worldly activities. In material pursuits, an incomplete project often yields no results, but in yoga, every sincere effort contributes to one's spiritual evolution. This verse has provided comfort and motivation to countless spiritual seekers throughout history, assuring them that their practice, however small or imperfect, is never in vain.",
