  "transliteration": "prāpya puṇya-kṛtāṁ lokān uṣitvā śāśvatīḥ samāḥ |\nśucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate ||41||",
  "translation": "Having attained the worlds of the righteous and dwelling there for countless years, the one who fell from yoga is born again in the house of the pure and prosperous.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses Arjuna's concern about the fate of a yogi who fails to complete the spiritual path. He assures that such a person is not lost but receives divine grace. After death, the unsuccessful yogi first enjoys the celestial realms earned through accumulated merit (punya), residing there for extended periods. This demonstrates that spiritual effort is never wasted and creates positive karmic momentum.\n\nAfter exhausting the heavenly rewards, the fallen yogi takes birth in a family that is both spiritually pure (śucīnām) and materially prosperous (śrīmatām). This favorable birth provides the ideal environment to resume spiritual practice. The combination of purity and prosperity ensures both the spiritual atmosphere and material resources necessary for yogic pursuit. This verse emphasizes the compassionate nature of the cosmic order, where sincere spiritual effort creates lasting impressions that carry forward across lifetimes, ensuring eventual success on the path to liberation.",
