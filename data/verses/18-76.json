  "commentary": "This verse marks Sanjaya's ecstatic response to the divine dialogue he has witnessed and narrated to King Dhritarashtra. Through his divine vision granted by Vyasa, Sanjaya has been able to witness the entire conversation between Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The repetition of 'saṁsmṛtya' (remembering) and 'muhur muhuḥ' (again and again) emphasizes the inexhaustible joy and spiritual elevation that comes from contemplating this sacred teaching.\n\nSanjaya describes the dialogue as 'adbhutam' (wonderful, marvelous) and 'puṇyam' (sacred, meritorious), indicating that merely hearing or remembering this conversation is itself a spiritually purifying act. This verse serves as a testimony to the transformative power of the Gita's teachings. Sanjaya's repeated rejoicing suggests that the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita is not something to be heard once and forgotten, but rather a teaching that yields deeper insights and greater joy with each contemplation. His ecstasy foreshadows the ultimate victory of the Pandavas, as the presence of Krishna and righteousness ensures success.",
