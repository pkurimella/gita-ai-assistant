  "transliteration": "māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ |\nstriyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te'pi yānti parāṁ gatim ||32||",
  "translation": "O son of Pritha, those who take refuge in Me, even if they be of lower birth—women, vaishyas (merchants), and shudras (laborers)—they too attain the Supreme Goal.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the universal accessibility of divine grace and the path of devotion (bhakti). He declares that spiritual realization is not limited by birth, social status, gender, or any external circumstance. Anyone who sincerely takes refuge in the Divine can attain the highest spiritual goal. The term 'pāpa-yonayaḥ' refers to those considered of lower birth according to the social conventions of the time, while the specific mention of women, vaishyas, and shudras addresses the prevailing social hierarchies.\n\nThis verse is revolutionary in its assertion of spiritual equality and democratization of the path to liberation. Krishna is dismantling the rigid social barriers that restricted spiritual practices to certain castes or genders. The key requirement is 'vyapāśritya'—taking complete refuge or surrender to the Divine. This emphasizes that devotion and surrender are the true qualifications for spiritual attainment, not birth or social position. The verse reinforces the central theme of Chapter 9 that bhakti (devotion) is the supreme and most accessible path, available to all regardless of worldly distinctions.",
