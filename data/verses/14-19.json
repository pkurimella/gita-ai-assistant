  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Division of the Three Gunas",
  "sanskrit": "नान्यं गुणेभ्यः कर्तारं यदा द्रष्टानुपश्यति ।\nगुणेभ्यश्च परं वेत्ति मद्भावं सोऽधिगच्छति ॥१९॥",
  "transliteration": "nānyaṁ guṇebhyaḥ kartāraṁ yadā draṣṭānupaśyati |\nguṇebhyaś ca paraṁ vetti madbhāvaṁ so'dhigacchati ||19||",
  "translation": "When the seer perceives no agent of action other than the gunas, and knows That which is beyond the gunas, he attains My divine nature.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the realization that leads to liberation and union with the Divine. When a spiritual seeker develops the discriminative vision to perceive that all actions in the material world are merely interactions of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), and that the true Self is not the doer, a profound shift in consciousness occurs. The enlightened seer (draṣṭā) recognizes that what appears as individual agency is actually the mechanical play of nature's qualities, while the witnessing consciousness remains untouched and transcendent.\n\nThe second part of the verse emphasizes the importance of not stopping at this negative knowledge alone. Beyond recognizing what is not the Self (the gunas and their activities), one must also realize what IS—the supreme reality that transcends all qualities. This transcendent reality is Krishna's divine nature (madbhāva), the pure consciousness that is beyond all material modifications. This dual realization—that actions belong to the gunas and that one's true nature is the transcendent Self—is the key to liberation.\n\nThis verse is central to the teaching of Chapter 14, as it shows the practical application of understanding the three gunas. It is not mere theoretical knowledge but a transformative vision that fundamentally changes one's relationship with action, identity, and ultimate reality. When this vision is stabilized, the aspirant transcends the binding influence of the gunas and realizes union with the Supreme.",
