  "sanskrit": "नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् ।\nपश्यञ्शृण्वन्स्पृशञ्जिघ्रन्नश्नन्गच्छन्स्वपञ्श्वसन् ॥",
  "transliteration": "naiva kiñcit karomīti yukto manyeta tattvavit |\npaśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighran naśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan ||",
  "translation": "The knower of truth, remaining united with the Divine, should think 'I do nothing at all'—even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, and breathing.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the consciousness of a self-realized yogi who understands the true nature of action. Though engaged in all normal bodily activities—seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, and breathing—such a person remains established in the awareness that the true Self (Atman) is not the doer. The term 'tattvavit' (knower of truth) indicates one who has realized that all actions are performed by the gunas (qualities) of Prakriti (nature), while the Self remains the unchanging witness.\n\nThis verse is central to the teaching of Karma Yoga presented in this chapter. It resolves the apparent paradox between action and renunciation by showing that true renunciation is not the abandonment of action but the abandonment of the sense of doership and attachment to results. The yogi remains 'yukta' (united) with the Supreme consciousness while the body-mind complex performs its natural functions. This understanding liberates one from the binding effects of karma while allowing full participation in life's activities. It represents the practical application of the discrimination between the Self and the not-Self, which is essential for spiritual liberation.",
