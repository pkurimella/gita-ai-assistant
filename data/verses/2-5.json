  "sanskrit": "गुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्श्रेयो भोक्तुं भैक्ष्यमपीह लोके।\nहत्वार्थकामांस्तु गुरूनिहैव भुञ्जीय भोगान्रुधिरप्रदिग्धान्॥",
  "transliteration": "gurūn ahatvā hi mahānubhāvān śreyo bhoktuṁ bhaikṣyam apīha loke |\nhatvārtha-kāmāṁs tu gurūn ihaiva bhuñjīya bhogān rudhira-pradigdhān ||",
  "translation": "It would be better to live in this world by begging than to slay these noble teachers. By killing these elders who seek their legitimate ends, I would only enjoy blood-stained pleasures in this world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to express his moral anguish at the prospect of fighting against his revered teachers, particularly Dronacharya and Bhishma. He argues that even a life of begging, which was considered the lowest form of sustenance for a warrior of his status, would be preferable to killing these great souls (mahānubhāvān). This reveals the depth of his emotional conflict and his genuine respect for his elders.\n\nArjuna's reasoning reflects a utilitarian ethical concern: any kingdom or wealth gained through such a war would be tainted with the blood of his gurus and kinsmen. The phrase 'rudhira-pradigdhān' (blood-stained) powerfully conveys his view that the fruits of victory would be morally contaminated. He sees his teachers as having legitimate worldly goals (artha-kāmān), making their destruction even more troubling to his conscience.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding Arjuna's state of mind at the beginning of Krishna's teaching. His arguments appear ethical and compassionate on the surface, but Krishna will later reveal that they stem from attachment, confusion about dharma, and a limited understanding of the true nature of the Self. Arjuna's dilemma represents the universal human struggle between emotional attachment and duty, between personal sentiment and cosmic law.",
