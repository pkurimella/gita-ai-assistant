  "transliteration": "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ |\nbahavo jñāna-tapasā pūtā mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Freed from attachment, fear, and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, many have been purified by the austerity of knowledge and have attained My state of being.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the path by which countless seekers have attained divine realization throughout history. The verse emphasizes three primary obstacles that must be overcome: rāga (attachment), bhaya (fear), and krodha (anger). These represent the fundamental disturbances of the mind that prevent spiritual progress. When one becomes 'man-mayā' (absorbed in the Divine) and takes complete refuge in the Supreme, these obstacles naturally dissolve.\n\nThe phrase 'jñāna-tapasā' (austerity of knowledge) is particularly significant. It indicates that knowledge itself becomes a form of tapas or spiritual discipline. This is not mere intellectual understanding, but a transformative wisdom that purifies the entire being. The purification (pūta) mentioned here refers to the cleansing of all karmic impressions and mental impurities that bind the soul to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThis verse provides historical validation to Krishna's earlier statements about His repeated incarnations and teachings. It assures Arjuna that the path Krishna describes is not theoretical but has been successfully traversed by many realized souls. The attainment of 'mad-bhāva' (My state of being) represents the ultimate goal of yoga - complete union with the Divine, where the individual consciousness merges with the Supreme Consciousness while retaining its essential nature.",
