  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his enumeration of the various relatives and revered persons assembled on the battlefield whom he would have to kill in order to gain victory. He lists teachers (ācāryas), fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other family connections. This comprehensive listing emphasizes the deeply personal nature of this war and Arjuna's growing horror at the prospect of fratricide on such a massive scale.\n\nArjuna's detailed cataloging of relationships serves to heighten the emotional and moral crisis he faces. These are not merely enemies or strangers, but people bound to him through sacred bonds of kinship, education, and family ties. The mention of ācāryas (teachers) is particularly significant in the Indian context, where the guru-disciple relationship is considered as sacred as, or even more sacred than, the parent-child relationship. This verse demonstrates how Arjuna's warrior duty (kṣatriya-dharma) conflicts directly with his familial duties and natural human affection, creating the moral dilemma that forms the foundation for Krishna's teachings in the subsequent chapters.",
