  "sanskrit": "तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि मोहनं सर्वदेहिनाम्।\nप्रमादालस्यनिद्राभिस्तन्निबध्नाति भारत॥",
  "transliteration": "tamas tv ajñāna-jaṁ viddhi mohanaṁ sarva-dehinām |\npramādālasya-nidrābhis tan nibadhnāti bhārata ||",
  "translation": "Know that tamas is born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings. It binds through heedlessness, laziness, and sleep, O Bharata.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the third and lowest of the three gunas—tamas. Unlike sattva which illuminates and rajas which activates, tamas is characterized by ignorance (ajñāna) and delusion (mohana). It clouds the discriminative faculty of all embodied souls, preventing them from perceiving reality as it truly is. This guna represents darkness, inertia, and the absence of knowledge.\n\nKrishna identifies three primary manifestations through which tamas binds the soul: pramāda (heedlessness or negligence), ālasya (laziness or sloth), and nidrā (excessive sleep). These qualities keep a person in a state of spiritual unconsciousness, preventing any progress toward self-realization. Heedlessness causes one to neglect duties and spiritual practices; laziness prevents action even when one knows what should be done; and excessive sleep represents a state of complete inertia and unawareness. Together, these create a powerful bondage that keeps the soul trapped in ignorance.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the complete picture of the three gunas. While sattva leads to knowledge and rajas to action (though with attachment), tamas leads to complete stagnation and spiritual darkness. The Gita's teaching here is that one must recognize and transcend all three gunas, but tamas represents the most fundamental obstacle as it prevents even the awareness necessary for spiritual growth. The path forward requires cultivating sattva to overcome tamas, then ultimately transcending all three gunas to reach the state beyond the gunas.",
