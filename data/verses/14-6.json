  "sanskrit": "तत्र सत्त्वं निर्मलत्वात्प्रकाशकमनामयम्।\nसुखसङ्गेन बध्नाति ज्ञानसङ्गेन चानघ।।",
  "transliteration": "tatra sattvaṁ nirmalatvāt prakāśakam anāmayam |\nsukha-saṅgena badhnāti jñāna-saṅgena cānagha ||",
  "translation": "Of these, sattva, being pure, is luminous and free from evil. It binds one by attachment to happiness and by attachment to knowledge, O sinless one.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins to describe the specific characteristics and binding effects of sattva guna, the first of the three fundamental qualities of material nature. Though sattva is described as pure (nirmala), luminous (prakāśaka), and free from disease or evil (anāmaya), Krishna reveals its paradoxical nature: even this most refined quality binds the soul. The binding occurs through two primary attachments—to happiness (sukha) and to knowledge (jñāna). This indicates that even positive experiences and intellectual pursuits, when approached with attachment, create bondage.\n\nThe significance of this teaching lies in understanding that sattva guna, while superior to rajas and tamas, still operates within the realm of material nature and therefore creates subtle bondage. Those dominated by sattva may become attached to peaceful states, virtuous feelings, and intellectual achievements, thinking 'I am happy' or 'I am wise.' This identification with temporary states of consciousness prevents the realization of one's true nature beyond all gunas. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'anagha' (sinless), perhaps to encourage him that understanding these binding mechanisms is itself a step toward transcendence. The verse sets the foundation for understanding why even sattvic qualities must eventually be transcended for complete liberation.",
