  "sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच।\nएवमुक्त्वा हृषीकेशं गुडाकेशः परन्तपः।\nन योत्स्य इति गोविन्दमुक्त्वा तूष्णीं बभूव ह॥",
  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\nevam uktvā hṛṣīkeśaṁ guḍākeśaḥ parantapaḥ\nna yotsya iti govindam uktvā tūṣṇīṁ babhūva ha",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (Krishna), Gudakesha (Arjuna), the conqueror of enemies, said to Govinda, 'I will not fight,' and became silent.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a critical turning point in the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna. After expressing all his doubts, moral concerns, and emotional turmoil regarding the impending battle, Arjuna makes a definitive declaration of his refusal to fight. The verse is narrated by Sanjaya to King Dhritarashtra, reminding us that this entire conversation is being witnessed and reported from a distance through divine vision.\n\nThe use of three different names for Krishna (Hrishikesha, Govinda) and Arjuna (Gudakesha, Parantapa) is significant. Hrishikesha means 'Lord of the senses,' Govinda means 'giver of joy to the cows and senses,' while Gudakesha means 'conqueror of sleep' and Parantapa means 'scorcher of foes.' These epithets create an ironic contrast—Arjuna, who is called the conqueror of enemies, is now refusing to fight, while Krishna, the master of senses, will now guide Arjuna to control his own confused mind and emotions.\n\nArjuna's silence after his declaration represents complete surrender and receptivity. Having exhausted all his arguments and objections, he falls silent, creating the perfect condition for receiving Krishna's profound teachings. This moment of silence is the gateway to the spiritual wisdom that follows, as Arjuna has now moved from argumentative resistance to humble receptivity, making him ready for the transformative knowledge Krishna is about to impart.",
