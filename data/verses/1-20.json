  "sanskrit": "अथ व्यवस्थितान्दृष्ट्वा धार्तराष्ट्रान्कपिध्वजः।\nप्रवृत्ते शस्त्रसम्पाते धनुरुद्यम्य पाण्डवः॥",
  "transliteration": "atha vyavasthitān dṛṣṭvā dhārtarāṣṭrān kapi-dhvajaḥ |\npravṛtte śastra-sampāte dhanur udyamya pāṇḍavaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Then, seeing the sons of Dhritarashtra standing arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, whose flag bore the emblem of Hanuman, took up his bow.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial transition in the narrative. After surveying both armies and recognizing his kinsmen, teachers, and friends on both sides, Arjuna prepares for battle by raising his bow. The epithet 'kapi-dhvaja' (one whose flag bears the monkey emblem) refers to Hanuman on Arjuna's chariot flag, symbolizing divine blessing and strength. This detail is significant as it reminds us of Arjuna's heroic stature and his connection to divine forces.\n\nThe verse captures the precise moment when the battle is about to commence ('pravṛtte śastra-sampāte'). Arjuna's action of raising his bow appears to be a warrior's natural response to the imminent conflict. However, this moment of apparent readiness becomes the prelude to his moral crisis. The verse sets up the dramatic contrast between Arjuna's external preparedness as a warrior and his internal turmoil that will soon overwhelm him.\n\nThis transitional verse is important because it shows Arjuna initially fulfilling his kshatriya duty by preparing to fight. What follows in the subsequent verses is his sudden collapse into confusion and grief, which becomes the catalyst for Krishna's teachings. The verse thus represents the last moment of Arjuna's conventional warrior consciousness before his spiritual crisis begins.",
