  "translation": "The objects of sense turn away from the abstinent person, leaving the longing behind. But even this longing ceases when one sees the Supreme.",
  "commentary": "This verse addresses the limitation of mere sense control through willpower or austerity. Krishna explains that while a person practicing abstinence may succeed in withdrawing from sense objects (viṣayā), the subtle taste or craving (rasa) for those objects often remains. This is an incomplete renunciation, as the inner desire continues to exist, waiting for an opportunity to manifest.\n\nThe second line reveals the complete solution: when one experiences the higher taste of spiritual realization—the vision of the Supreme (paraṁ dṛṣṭvā)—even this subtle longing naturally falls away. This is not suppression but transcendence. The soul, having tasted something infinitely superior, loses interest in lower pleasures automatically, just as a child loses interest in toys upon growing up.\n\nThis verse is crucial in the context of Chapter 2's teaching on sthita-prajña (the person of steady wisdom). It establishes that true spiritual stability comes not from forced renunciation but from positive spiritual experience. This principle underlies the entire Gita's approach to yoga—offering a higher alternative rather than mere negation of worldly life. It bridges the discussion from mere sense control to the necessity of direct spiritual realization.",
