  "transliteration": "na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ |\nmāyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ ||",
  "translation": "The foolish evildoers, the lowest of mankind, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion, and who partake of a demoniac nature, do not surrender unto Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains why certain people do not turn to the Divine despite their suffering or needs. He categorizes four types of people who fail to surrender: the duṣkṛtinaḥ (evildoers) who engage in sinful activities, the mūḍhāḥ (foolish) who lack discrimination, the narādhamāḥ (lowest among humans) who misuse their human intelligence for base purposes, and those whose knowledge has been stolen by māyā (divine illusion). These individuals have adopted an āsura bhāva (demoniac nature), characterized by atheism, materialism, and denial of higher spiritual truths.\n\nThis verse provides the counterpoint to the previous verse which described the four types of virtuous people who do approach God. Here Krishna explains that those who are deeply entrenched in ignorance and vice cannot recognize the Divine due to their own choices and tendencies. The phrase 'māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ' is particularly significant—it indicates that their discrimination has been covered by illusion, not that they lack intelligence, but that they misapply it toward materialistic and egoistic ends. This verse emphasizes the importance of moral and spiritual orientation in one's approach to the Divine, suggesting that knowledge without virtue leads one away from God rather than toward Him.",
