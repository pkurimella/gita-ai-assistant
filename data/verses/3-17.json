  "sanskrit": "यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानवः।\nआत्मन्येव च सन्तुष्टस्तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "yas tv ātma-ratir eva syād ātma-tṛptaś ca mānavaḥ |\nātmany eva ca santuṣṭas tasya kāryaṃ na vidyate ||",
  "translation": "But for one who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied in the Self, and who is content in the Self alone—for such a person, there is no duty that needs to be performed.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a profound exception to the universal law of obligatory action discussed in the previous verses. Krishna describes the state of a self-realized soul (jñānī) who has transcended the binding nature of karma. Such a person finds complete fulfillment within their own Self (Atman), experiencing inner joy (ātma-rati), satisfaction (ātma-tṛpta), and contentment (santuṣṭa) that is entirely self-contained and independent of external circumstances or achievements.\n\nHowever, this verse must be understood carefully within the context of Chapter 3. Krishna is not advocating inaction for ordinary seekers, but rather describing the state of one who has already attained Self-realization. For such a liberated being, there are no binding duties because they have transcended the ego-sense that creates the feeling of being a doer. They are beyond the three guṇas and the cycle of desire-driven action. This does not mean they become inactive; rather, their actions flow spontaneously without any sense of personal agency or expectation of results.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in distinguishing between two paths: karma yoga for those still on the spiritual journey, and the natural state of the liberated soul who acts without any sense of obligation or bondage. This verse serves as an aspirational goal while simultaneously justifying why Arjuna, who has not yet reached this state, must engage in his prescribed duties. It establishes that liberation is characterized by complete self-sufficiency and inner fulfillment, where external actions no longer bind the individual to the cycle of karma.",
