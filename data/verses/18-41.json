  "translation": "O scorcher of foes, the duties of the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature.",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces Krishna's teaching on the varna system (social order) based on inherent qualities (gunas) rather than birth alone. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'parantapa' (scorcher of foes) and explains that the division of duties among the four varnas—Brahmins (priests and teachers), Kshatriyas (warriors and administrators), Vaishyas (merchants and farmers), and Shudras (laborers and service providers)—is determined by svabhava (one's inherent nature) as manifested through the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas).\n\nThis verse is significant in the context of Chapter 18 as it relates to the theme of performing one's ordained duty (svadharma). Krishna is preparing to explain in subsequent verses the specific qualities and duties of each varna, emphasizing that true fulfillment comes from performing actions aligned with one's natural disposition. This teaching counters rigid caste-by-birth interpretations and instead presents a more fluid understanding based on inherent qualities and tendencies. The philosophical significance lies in recognizing that social organization, when properly understood, reflects natural human diversity in temperament and capability, and that each person can achieve perfection by following their own nature-based path.",
