  "translation": "Your enemies will speak many unspeakable words, scorning your ability and strength. What could be more painful than that?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His argument to persuade Arjuna to fight by appealing to his sense of honor and reputation. Krishna warns that if Arjuna flees from battle, his enemies will not simply celebrate victory—they will heap insults upon him, questioning his capability as a warrior and mocking his strength. They will speak avācya-vādāḥ (unspeakable or inappropriate words) that attack his very character and competence.\n\nThis verse is part of Krishna's strategic appeal to Arjuna's kṣatriya dharma and warrior pride. After explaining the immortality of the soul and the inevitability of duty, Krishna now addresses the practical consequences of abandoning the battlefield. For a warrior of Arjuna's stature, being ridiculed as a coward and having his abilities questioned would be a fate worse than death itself. The rhetorical question at the end—'What could be more painful than that?'—emphasizes that such dishonor would cause greater suffering than any physical wound or even death in battle.\n\nThis argument must be understood in the context of dharma and social duty in ancient Indian society. For a kṣatriya, reputation and honor were intrinsically tied to courage and martial ability. Krishna is not merely appealing to ego, but reminding Arjuna that abandoning his dharma would result in consequences more painful than the grief he currently feels. This verse bridges the philosophical teachings about the eternal soul with the practical realities of worldly duty and social responsibility.",
