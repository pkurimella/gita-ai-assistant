  "sanskrit": "यथैधांसि समिद्धोऽग्निर्भस्मसात्कुरुतेऽर्जुन। ज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते तथा॥",
  "transliteration": "yathaidhāṁsi samiddho'gnir bhasmasāt kurute'rjuna | jñānāgniḥ sarvakarmāṇi bhasmasāt kurute tathā ||",
  "translation": "Just as a blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.",
  "commentary": "In this powerful metaphor, Krishna illustrates the transformative power of spiritual knowledge (jñāna). Just as fire completely consumes wood and reduces it to ashes, leaving no trace of its original form, the fire of self-knowledge burns away all karmas—both their binding effects and the accumulated impressions (saṁskāras) they create. This verse emphasizes that true knowledge is not merely intellectual understanding but a transformative realization that fundamentally alters one's relationship with action.\n\nThe comparison to fire is particularly significant in Vedic tradition, where Agni (fire) is considered a purifying force. The knowledge referred to here is the direct realization of one's true nature as the eternal Self (Ātman), distinct from the body-mind complex that performs actions. When this knowledge dawns, one realizes that the Self is never the doer of actions—it is always the witness. This understanding neutralizes the karma-producing capacity of actions, as actions performed with this awareness do not bind the individual to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThis verse comes in the context of Krishna's teaching about karma-yoga and jñāna-yoga. He is building toward the conclusion that knowledge is the ultimate purifier and liberator. The verse serves as a bridge, showing that while action (karma) is necessary and valuable, it is knowledge (jñāna) that ultimately grants liberation (mokṣa). This doesn't negate the importance of action but places it in proper perspective—actions should be performed, but with the wisdom that transcends their binding nature.",
