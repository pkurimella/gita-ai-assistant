  "sanskrit": "सांख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः ।\nएकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम् ॥४॥",
  "transliteration": "sāṅkhya-yogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ |\nekam apy āsthitaḥ samyag ubhayor vindate phalam ||4||",
  "translation": "Only the ignorant speak of knowledge (Sankhya) and the yoga of action (Karma Yoga) as different, not the wise. One who is properly established in either of these gains the fruit of both.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a common misconception that the path of knowledge (Sankhya) and the path of selfless action (Karma Yoga) are fundamentally different and lead to different goals. He declares that only the immature and ignorant (bālāḥ) consider these two paths as separate, while the truly wise (paṇḍitāḥ) understand their essential unity. Both paths, when followed correctly and completely, lead to the same ultimate realization of the Self and liberation from bondage.\n\nThe key insight here is that knowledge and action are not contradictory but complementary approaches to the same truth. The path of knowledge involves understanding the distinction between the eternal Self and the temporary body-mind complex, while Karma Yoga involves performing one's duties without attachment to results. When practiced properly (samyak), either path naturally incorporates elements of the other. The person of knowledge naturally acts without attachment, and the selfless worker gradually develops discriminative wisdom. This verse establishes the philosophical foundation that there are multiple valid paths to the same spiritual goal, a recurring theme throughout the Gita.\n\nKrishna's statement serves to reconcile what might appear to be his contradictory advice to Arjuna. Rather than choosing between renunciation and action, Arjuna should understand that the essence of both paths is the same: transcending ego-identification and realizing one's true nature. This understanding is crucial for the subsequent verses where Krishna will elaborate on how these paths converge in their ultimate aim.",
