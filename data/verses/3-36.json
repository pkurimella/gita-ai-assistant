  "translation": "Arjuna said: O descendant of Vrishni (Krishna), what is it that impels a person to commit sin, even unwillingly, as if driven by force?",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial turning point in Chapter 3, where Arjuna asks one of the most profound psychological and spiritual questions. Having heard Krishna's teachings on karma yoga and the importance of performing one's duty, Arjuna now inquires about the root cause of sinful behavior. He observes that people often act against their better judgment, committing actions they know to be wrong, as if compelled by some invisible force. This question reflects the universal human experience of internal conflict between knowing what is right and being drawn toward what is wrong.\n\nArjuna's question demonstrates his deepening understanding and genuine spiritual inquiry. He is not merely seeking theoretical knowledge but wants to understand the practical obstacles to righteous living. The phrase 'balād iva niyojitaḥ' (as if driven by force) captures the sense of helplessness that people often feel when succumbing to negative impulses. This sets the stage for Krishna's famous response about kāma (desire) and krodha (anger) as the great enemies of spiritual progress. The question is particularly relevant in the context of karma yoga, as one cannot perform selfless action if one is constantly pulled by inner compulsions toward selfish and harmful behavior.",
