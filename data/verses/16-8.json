  "transliteration": "asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram |\naparasparasambhūtaṁ kim anyat kāmahaitukam ||8||",
  "translation": "They say that the world is unreal, without foundation, without a God, not brought about by mutual cooperation of cause and effect, and caused by nothing other than lust.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the nihilistic worldview held by those of demoniac nature. They deny the existence of any ultimate reality (asatya), any moral foundation (apratiṣṭha), and any divine governance (anīśvara) of the universe. According to their philosophy, the world is merely a random occurrence without any higher purpose or divine order. They reject the law of karma and the systematic relationship between cause and effect that governs creation.\n\nThe demoniac view reduces all existence to mere sensual desire (kāma) as the sole driving force. They believe that the universe arose accidentally through random union (aparasparasambhūta) rather than through divine will or cosmic law. This materialistic philosophy denies any transcendent purpose to life and reduces human existence to the pursuit of sensory gratification. Such a worldview, Krishna indicates, leads to destructive behavior as it removes all moral restraints and spiritual aspirations, making desire the only motivating principle of life.",
