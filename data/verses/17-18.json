  "translation": "Austerity performed with ostentation for the sake of gaining respect, honor, and worship, is said to be in the mode of passion. Such austerity is unstable and temporary.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes tamasic austerity performed in the mode of passion (rajas). Unlike sattvic austerity which is performed with faith and without expectation of reward, rajasic austerity is undertaken with ulterior motives. The practitioner seeks external validation through respect (satkara), honor (mana), and worship (puja) from others. Such practices are performed with pride and ostentation (dambha), making a show of one's spiritual discipline to impress others.\n\nKrishna characterizes such austerity as 'chalam' (unstable) and 'adhruvam' (temporary or impermanent). This is because it depends entirely on external circumstances and the opinions of others. When the desired recognition is not forthcoming, or when the practitioner's ego is not sufficiently gratified, the austerity is abandoned. The fruits of such practices are also temporary, as they are rooted in ego and desire rather than in genuine spiritual aspiration. This verse serves as a warning against spiritual materialism—the tendency to use spiritual practices for worldly gains or social status, which ultimately defeats the very purpose of tapas as a means of self-purification and God-realization.",
