  "transliteration": "tasmāt tvam uttiṣṭha yaśo labhasva jitvā śatrūn bhuṅkṣva rājyaṁ samṛddham |\nmayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam eva nimittamātraṁ bhava savyasācin ||",
  "translation": "Therefore, arise and attain glory! Conquer your enemies and enjoy a prosperous kingdom. These warriors have already been slain by Me; be merely an instrument, O Arjuna, the ambidextrous archer.",
  "commentary": "In this pivotal verse, Krishna directly commands Arjuna to rise and fight, assuring him that the outcome of the battle has already been determined by divine will. Krishna reveals that all the warriors standing before Arjuna have already been killed by Him in the cosmic scheme of things. This profound statement addresses the fundamental question of free will versus divine determinism. Arjuna is being asked to become a 'nimitta-mātra' (mere instrument) in the hands of the Divine, executing what has already been ordained.\n\nThis verse resolves Arjuna's moral dilemma by shifting the perspective from personal agency to divine instrumentality. Krishna is not asking Arjuna to take responsibility for killing his relatives; rather, He is revealing that the cosmic process has already unfolded at a transcendent level, and Arjuna's role is simply to participate consciously in this divine plan. The reference to 'savyasācin' (ambidextrous archer) reminds Arjuna of his unique capabilities and dharmic duty as a warrior. This teaching emphasizes the yogic principle of performing one's duty without attachment to results, recognizing that one is merely an instrument of a higher cosmic order.\n\nThe verse also promises worldly success—glory and a prosperous kingdom—but more importantly, it offers spiritual liberation through the understanding that all actions ultimately belong to the Divine. This is the essence of Karma Yoga: acting in the world while recognizing the Supreme as the true doer, thereby transcending the bondage of action.",
