  "sanskrit": "वायुर्यमोऽग्निर्वरुणः शशाङ्कः प्रजापतिस्त्वं प्रपितामहश्च |\nनमो नमस्तेऽस्तु सहस्रकृत्वः पुनश्च भूयोऽपि नमो नमस्ते ||",
  "transliteration": "vāyur yamo 'gnir varuṇaḥ śaśāṅkaḥ prajāpatis tvaṁ prapitāmahaś ca |\nnamo namas te 'stu sahasra-kṛtvaḥ punaś ca bhūyo 'pi namo namas te ||",
  "translation": "You are Vayu (the wind-god), Yama (the god of death), Agni (the fire-god), Varuna (the water-god), the Moon, Prajapati (the creator), and the great-grandfather of all. Salutations, salutations to You a thousand times, and again and again, salutations, salutations to You!",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his hymn of praise to Krishna's Universal Form, identifying Him with various cosmic deities and natural forces. He recognizes that all the gods worshipped in the Vedic tradition—Vayu (wind), Yama (death), Agni (fire), Varuna (water), and the Moon—are merely manifestations of the one Supreme Reality standing before him. By addressing Krishna as Prajapati (the lord of creatures) and Prapitamaha (the great-grandfather, even beyond Brahma who is called Pitamaha), Arjuna acknowledges that Krishna is the ultimate source from which even the creator Brahma emerges.\n\nThe repetition of salutations (namo namaḥ) expressed a thousand times and then again and again reveals Arjuna's overwhelming devotion and his recognition that no amount of praise can adequately honor the infinite Lord. This verse demonstrates the Vedantic principle that all deities are ultimately forms of the one Supreme Being. The various gods represent different cosmic functions and natural forces, but they all derive their power from the one ultimate Reality. Arjuna's realization here transcends polytheism and reaches the understanding of the fundamental unity underlying all divine manifestations, which is a central teaching of the Bhagavad Gita and Vedanta philosophy.",
