  "transliteration": "tapasvibhyo 'dhiko yogī jñānibhyo 'pi mato 'dhikaḥ |\nkarmibhyaś cādhiko yogī tasmād yogī bhavārjuna ||46||",
  "translation": "The yogi is superior to the ascetics, superior even to those of knowledge, and superior to those engaged in ritualistic action. Therefore, O Arjuna, be a yogi.",
  "commentary": "In this concluding verse of the chapter on meditation, Krishna establishes the supremacy of the path of yoga over other spiritual disciplines. He declares that the yogi—one who practices meditation and seeks union with the Divine—surpasses three categories of spiritual practitioners: the tapasvins (ascetics who perform austerities), the jñānīs (those who pursue intellectual knowledge), and the karmīs (those who perform ritualistic actions). This hierarchy is not meant to diminish other paths but to emphasize the comprehensive nature of yoga, which integrates discipline, wisdom, and action in devotion to the Supreme.\n\nThe verse serves as Krishna's direct exhortation to Arjuna to embrace the yogic path. Throughout Chapter 6, Krishna has elaborated on dhyana yoga—the yoga of meditation—explaining its techniques, challenges, and ultimate rewards. Here he synthesizes his teaching by positioning the yogi as the ideal spiritual aspirant. The yogi's superiority lies in the balanced approach that combines self-discipline (like the ascetic), wisdom (like the philosopher), and purposeful action (like the ritualist), all directed toward God-realization. This verse transitions naturally to Chapter 7, where Krishna will reveal that among all yogis, the bhakti-yogi—one who worships with devotion—is the highest, thus foreshadowing the devotional emphasis that becomes increasingly prominent in subsequent chapters.",
