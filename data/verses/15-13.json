  "translation": "Entering the earth, I support all beings with My vital energy. Becoming the nectarean moon, I nourish all plants and herbs.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna continues to describe His all-pervading presence and sustaining power in the universe. He explains how He enters the earth element and, through His vital energy (ojas), holds and supports all living beings. This demonstrates the divine presence in the very foundation of material existence—the earth that sustains all life forms.\n\nThe second part of the verse reveals Krishna's role in nourishing vegetation through the moon. In Vedic understanding, the moon (soma) is considered the presiding deity of plant life and vegetation, providing the cooling, nourishing essence (rasa) that enables plants to grow and flourish. By identifying Himself with the moon's nourishing quality, Krishna shows how He is the ultimate source of sustenance for all life. The moon's rays are believed to contain life-giving properties that help plants absorb nutrients and grow, especially at night.\n\nThis verse is significant in establishing the immanent aspect of the Divine—how God is not merely a distant creator but actively present and functioning within creation itself. It demonstrates that all natural processes, from the earth's ability to support life to the moon's nourishing influence on vegetation, are manifestations of divine energy. This understanding helps devotees recognize the sacred in nature and see God's hand in all sustaining forces of the universe.",
