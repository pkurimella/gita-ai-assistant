  "transliteration": "man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru |\nmām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo'si me ||",
  "translation": "Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow down to Me. Thus you shall come to Me alone. This I promise you truly, for you are dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "This verse represents one of the most direct and intimate instructions from Krishna to Arjuna in the entire Bhagavad Gita. Krishna prescribes a fourfold spiritual practice: fixing the mind on the Divine (man-manā), cultivating devotion (mad-bhakta), performing worship and sacrifice (mad-yājī), and offering reverent salutations (namaskuru). These four practices encompass the complete spectrum of spiritual discipline—mental, emotional, ritual, and physical—all directed toward the Supreme.\n\nThe verse is particularly significant because Krishna makes a solemn promise (pratijāne) to Arjuna, assuring him that following this path will lead directly to union with the Divine. The phrase 'satyaṁ te pratijāne' (I promise you truly) emphasizes the certainty of this outcome. Krishna's declaration that Arjuna is dear to Him (priyo'si me) reveals the personal, loving relationship between the devotee and the Divine, which is the foundation of bhakti yoga.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18, which synthesizes all the teachings of the Gita, this verse presents the essence of devotional surrender as the culminating practice. It shows that while knowledge, action, and renunciation are important, the path of loving devotion with complete mental absorption in the Divine is the most direct route to liberation. This verse is often considered the heart of the Gita's message, emphasizing that divine grace flows naturally to those who offer themselves completely to the Supreme.",
