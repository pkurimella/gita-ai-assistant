  "translation": "Whatever being exists that is glorious, prosperous, or powerful, know that to be a manifestation of a fragment of My splendor.",
  "commentary": "In this culminating verse of the Vibhuti Yoga chapter, Krishna provides a universal principle that encompasses all His previous examples of divine manifestations. Rather than continuing to enumerate specific examples, He offers Arjuna a comprehensive understanding: anything in creation that exhibits exceptional glory (vibhūti), prosperity (śrīmat), or power (ūrjita) is born from a mere fragment of His infinite divine splendor (tejas).\n\nThis verse serves as a master key for recognizing the Divine in all manifestations of excellence throughout creation. Krishna is teaching that wherever we encounter extraordinary beauty, power, knowledge, or any form of magnificence, we should recognize it as a partial expression of the Supreme Reality. The word 'aṁśa' (fragment) is particularly significant—it indicates that even the most magnificent manifestations in the universe represent only a tiny fraction of God's infinite glory. This understanding helps the spiritual aspirant develop a vision of the Divine pervading all of existence, transforming ordinary perception into sacred vision.\n\nPhilosophically, this verse establishes the principle of divine immanence while maintaining transcendence. The Supreme is both within all glorious manifestations and infinitely beyond them. This teaching encourages devotees to see the world as a theophany—a revelation of the Divine—while remembering that the Source infinitely transcends all Its manifestations. It provides a practical method for constant remembrance of God by recognizing His presence in all forms of excellence and greatness encountered in daily life.",
