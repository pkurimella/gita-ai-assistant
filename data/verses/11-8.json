  "sanskrit": "न तु मां शक्यसे द्रष्टुमनेनैव स्वचक्षुषा ।\nदिव्यं ददामि ते चक्षुः पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् ॥८॥",
  "transliteration": "na tu māṁ śakyase draṣṭum anenaiva svacakṣuṣā |\ndivyaṁ dadāmi te cakṣuḥ paśya me yogam aiśvaram ||8||",
  "translation": "But you cannot see Me with these, your own eyes. I give you divine vision; behold My supreme yogic power.",
  "commentary": "In this pivotal verse, Krishna explains that the cosmic form (Vishvarupa) cannot be perceived through ordinary human vision. The physical eyes, limited by material constraints, are incapable of witnessing the infinite, all-pervading universal form of the Divine. This limitation is not due to any deficiency in Arjuna's devotion or worthiness, but rather reflects the fundamental difference between material and spiritual perception.\n\nKrishna therefore grants Arjuna 'divya chakshuh' (divine eye or divine vision), a supernatural faculty that transcends the limitations of sensory perception. This divine vision represents spiritual insight that goes beyond the material realm. The term 'yogam aishvaram' (divine yogic power) refers to Krishna's supreme mystic power through which He manifests the entire cosmos within Himself. This verse marks the transition from theoretical knowledge to direct mystical experience, demonstrating that the highest spiritual truths cannot be grasped through intellectual understanding alone but require divine grace and transcendental perception.\n\nThis verse also establishes an important theological principle: while God is omnipresent and all-pervading, the realization of His supreme nature requires a transformation of consciousness. The divine vision granted here is not merely enhanced physical sight, but represents a complete elevation of Arjuna's consciousness to perceive reality as it truly is, beyond the veils of maya (illusion).",
