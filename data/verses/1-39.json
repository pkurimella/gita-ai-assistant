  "sanskrit": "यद्यप्येते न पश्यन्ति लोभोपहतचेतसः।\nकुलक्षयकृतं दोषं मित्रद्रोहे च पातकम्॥",
  "transliteration": "yady apy ete na paśyanti lobhopahata-cetasaḥ |\nkula-kṣaya-kṛtaṁ doṣaṁ mitra-drohe ca pātakam ||",
  "translation": "Even though these men, with minds overpowered by greed, do not see the evil in destroying the family and the sin in betraying friends,",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his moral argument against participating in the war. He acknowledges that the Kauravas, blinded by greed and ambition, cannot perceive the grave consequences of their actions—the destruction of family traditions and the betrayal of kinsmen. Their consciousness has been clouded by lobha (greed), making them unable to distinguish between dharma and adharma. However, Arjuna positions himself as one who can clearly see these consequences.\n\nThis verse is significant because it reveals Arjuna's moral sensitivity and his concern for dharma. He recognizes that greed has corrupted the judgment of his opponents, particularly Duryodhana and his supporters, who are willing to destroy family bonds for the sake of power. Arjuna uses this observation to build his case for why he, who can see clearly, should not participate in actions that lead to kula-kṣaya (family destruction). The verse sets up the contrast between those blinded by desire and those who claim moral clarity, though Krishna will later challenge whether Arjuna's perspective is truly as clear as he believes.",
