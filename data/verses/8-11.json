  "sanskrit": "यदक्षरं वेदविदो वदन्ति विशन्ति यद्यतयो वीतरागाः ।\nयदिच्छन्तो ब्रह्मचर्यं चरन्ति तत्ते पदं संग्रहेण प्रवक्ष्ये ॥११॥",
  "transliteration": "yad akṣaraṁ veda-vido vadanti viśanti yad yatayo vīta-rāgāḥ |\nyad icchanto brahmacaryaṁ caranti tat te padaṁ saṅgraheṇa pravakṣye ||11||",
  "translation": "That which the knowers of the Vedas call the Imperishable, which the self-controlled ascetics free from attachment enter, and desiring which seekers practice celibacy—that Goal I shall declare to you in brief.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna introduces the concept of Akshara Brahman—the Imperishable Reality—which He is about to explain in the following verses. He describes this supreme state through three characteristics: it is proclaimed by Vedic scholars as the ultimate truth, it is attained by renunciates who have conquered desires and attachments, and it is the goal for which spiritual aspirants practice brahmacharya (celibacy and self-control). This verse serves as a bridge, connecting the previous discussion about remembering the Divine at death with the practical method that will be described next.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the universality and supremacy of this goal across different spiritual paths. Whether one follows the path of knowledge (Vedic scholars), renunciation (ascetics), or disciplined practice (brahmacharis), all are seeking the same imperishable reality. Krishna's promise to explain this 'in brief' (saṅgraheṇa) indicates that what follows is a concise but complete teaching on the technique of reaching this supreme state. This sets the stage for the famous OM meditation instruction in the subsequent verses, showing how the abstract philosophical goal can be approached through concrete spiritual practice.",
