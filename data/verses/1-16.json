  "transliteration": "anantavijayaṁ rājā kuntīputro yudhiṣṭhiraḥ |\nnakulaḥ sahadevaśca sughoṣamaṇipuṣpakau ||",
  "translation": "King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch named Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conches named Sughosa and Manipushpaka respectively.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Sanjaya's description of the conch-blowing ceremony that marks the beginning of the Kurukshetra war. Here, the focus shifts to the remaining three Pandava brothers. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava and rightful heir to the throne, is specifically mentioned with his title 'raja' (king), emphasizing his legitimate claim to sovereignty. His conch Anantavijaya means 'endless victory,' symbolizing the eternal triumph of dharma over adharma.\n\nThe twin brothers Nakula and Sahadeva, sons of Madri through the Ashvini Kumaras, complete the roster of the five Pandava brothers. Their conches Sughosa (sweet-sounding) and Manipushpaka (jewel-bracelet) represent the harmonious and precious nature of their cause. This systematic enumeration of all five Pandavas and their divine conches serves to establish the completeness and unity of the righteous side, contrasting with the Kaurava forces driven by greed and ambition. The blowing of these conches is not merely a war signal but a cosmic announcement of the impending restoration of dharma.",
