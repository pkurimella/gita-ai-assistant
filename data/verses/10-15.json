  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna acknowledges the transcendental nature of Krishna's self-knowledge. He recognizes that Krishna, being the Supreme Reality (Puruṣottama), is self-luminous and self-aware, requiring no external means to know Himself. This is a fundamental distinction between the Divine and all created beings—while ordinary souls require means of knowledge to understand reality, the Supreme Being is eternally self-aware and self-evident. Arjuna uses four epithets to glorify Krishna, each highlighting a different aspect of His supremacy.\n\nThe verse serves as a bridge in Chapter 10, where Arjuna has been listening to Krishna's description of His divine manifestations (vibhūtis). Overwhelmed by the magnitude of Krishna's glories, Arjuna realizes that no finite being can fully comprehend the infinite. He acknowledges that only Krishna can truly know His own complete nature. This sets the stage for Arjuna's subsequent request for Krishna to enumerate His principal manifestations, not because Krishna needs to prove anything, but because Arjuna desires to meditate upon these forms. The verse emphasizes the epistemological gap between the finite and infinite, while simultaneously expressing the devotee's humble recognition of divine transcendence and the limitations of human understanding when approaching the Absolute.",
