  "translation": "Those who are deluded by the qualities (gunas) of material nature become attached to the activities born of these qualities. The person of complete knowledge should not unsettle the minds of the ignorant who have incomplete understanding.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses the practical challenge of how the wise should interact with those who are still bound by material consciousness. Those who are bewildered by the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) of prakrti (material nature) become attached to actions performed under the influence of these qualities. They identify themselves as the doers and become bound by their actions, lacking the discriminative knowledge that distinguishes the Self from the modes of nature.\n\nKrishna advises that the enlightened person (kṛtsna-vit) who possesses complete knowledge should not disturb or confuse those with incomplete understanding (akṛtsna-vit). The ignorant (mandān) are not yet capable of comprehending the higher truth of actionless action or the distinction between the Self and prakrti. If suddenly told to renounce all action, they might fall into inertia or confusion, which would be spiritually detrimental. Instead, the wise should lead by example, performing their duties with detachment while gradually elevating others through appropriate guidance.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of compassionate wisdom in spiritual teaching. It suggests a gradual approach to spiritual education, where people are guided according to their level of understanding and readiness. The enlightened should encourage others to perform their prescribed duties with dedication, which will naturally purify their consciousness over time and prepare them for higher knowledge. This reflects Krishna's overall teaching methodology in the Gita, where he presents various paths suitable for different temperaments and levels of spiritual evolution.",
