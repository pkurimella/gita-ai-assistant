  "translation": "O Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds that I must do, nor is there anything unattained that I need to attain, yet I engage in action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents himself as the supreme example of selfless action. Despite being the Supreme Lord who has already attained everything and has no personal obligations or duties to fulfill across the three worlds (heaven, earth, and the netherworld), he still engages in action. This is a profound teaching on karma yoga—action performed without personal necessity or desire for results.\n\nKrishna uses his own divine example to illustrate the principle he has been teaching Arjuna. If even God, who lacks nothing and needs nothing, continues to act, then how much more should human beings engage in their prescribed duties? This verse establishes the foundation for the next verse where Krishna will explain that if he were to cease acting, it would lead to cosmic disorder. The implication is clear: action is not merely for personal gain or out of compulsion, but serves a greater cosmic purpose.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of karma yoga. It demonstrates that the highest form of action is that which is performed without any sense of personal need or desire for reward. Krishna's example shows that true freedom does not mean cessation of action, but rather action performed in a state of complete fulfillment and for the welfare of the world. This sets the standard for all spiritual practitioners—to act not from a place of lack or compulsion, but from abundance and cosmic responsibility.",
