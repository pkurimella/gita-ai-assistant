  "translation": "Perform your prescribed duty, for action is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of your physical body cannot be accomplished through inaction.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna directly instructs Arjuna to perform his prescribed duties, establishing a fundamental principle of Karma Yoga. He presents two compelling arguments for action over inaction. First, he declares that action (karma) is inherently superior to complete inaction (akarma) from both a spiritual and practical standpoint. This addresses Arjuna's earlier confusion about whether renunciation or action is the better path.\n\nThe second part of the verse provides a practical, irrefutable argument: even basic bodily maintenance—eating, breathing, and sustaining life—requires action. Complete inaction is therefore impossible while living in a physical body. Krishna is emphasizing that since action is unavoidable, one should engage in prescribed duties (niyata karma) rather than falling into confusion or laziness. This verse establishes the foundation for the teaching that follows: not the abandonment of action, but the proper performance of action with the right attitude is the path to liberation. The term 'niyata karma' refers to duties prescribed according to one's nature and position in life, which when performed without selfish attachment, purify the mind and lead to spiritual progress.",
