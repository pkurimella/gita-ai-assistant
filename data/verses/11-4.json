  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna humbly requests Krishna to reveal His universal form (Vishvarupa). After hearing Krishna's description of His divine manifestations and cosmic powers in the previous verses, Arjuna's devotion and curiosity have been deeply stirred. However, Arjuna demonstrates great humility and wisdom by leaving the decision to Krishna, acknowledging that such a vision may be beyond his capacity as an ordinary mortal.\n\nArjuna addresses Krishna as 'Prabhu' (Lord) and 'Yogeshvara' (Master of Yoga), recognizing His supreme authority and divine power. By saying 'if You think it is possible for me to see,' Arjuna shows his understanding that the vision of God's universal form is not an ordinary experience and requires divine grace. He requests to see the 'avyaya atman' (imperishable Self), indicating his desire to perceive Krishna's eternal, unchanging divine nature that encompasses all of creation. This verse marks a pivotal moment in the Gita, as it leads to one of the most dramatic and profound revelations in all of Hindu scripture—the Vishvarupa darshana (vision of the cosmic form).",
