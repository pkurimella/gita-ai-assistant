  "sanskrit": "अनादिमध्यान्तमनन्तवीर्यमनन्तबाहुं शशिसूर्यनेत्रम्।\nपश्यामि त्वां दीप्तहुताशवक्त्रं स्वतेजसा विश्वमिदं तपन्तम्॥",
  "transliteration": "anādi-madhyāntam ananta-vīryam ananta-bāhuṁ śaśi-sūrya-netram |\npaśyāmi tvāṁ dīpta-hutāśa-vaktraṁ sva-tejasā viśvam idaṁ tapantam ||",
  "translation": "I behold You without beginning, middle, or end, infinite in power, with countless arms, the sun and moon as Your eyes, Your mouth a blazing fire, heating the entire universe with Your radiance.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his awestruck description of Krishna's cosmic form (Vishvarupa). He perceives the Lord as transcending all temporal limitations—without beginning (anādi), middle (madhya), or end (anta)—indicating the eternal nature of the Supreme Reality. The infinite power (ananta-vīrya) and countless arms (ananta-bāhu) represent the omnipotence and all-pervading activity of the Divine in sustaining and governing the universe.\n\nThe imagery becomes more vivid as Arjuna describes the sun and moon as the Lord's eyes, symbolizing divine vision that illuminates both day and night, the manifest and unmanifest aspects of creation. The blazing fire-like mouth (dīpta-hutāśa-vaktra) suggests both the creative and destructive powers of the Divine, as fire both purifies and consumes. This cosmic form radiates its own effulgence (sva-tejas), heating and energizing the entire universe, indicating that the Lord is self-luminous and the source of all energy and light in creation.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the transcendent and immanent nature of the Divine—beyond time yet pervading all space, beyond form yet manifesting in all forms. It reveals the philosophical truth that the Supreme Being is both the material and efficient cause of the universe, sustaining it through His own inherent power and radiance. This vision helps Arjuna understand that Krishna is not merely his charioteer and friend, but the ultimate reality underlying all existence.",
