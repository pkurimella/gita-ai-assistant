  "sanskrit": "यथाकाशस्थितो नित्यं वायुः सर्वत्रगो महान्।\nतथा सर्वाणि भूतानि मत्स्थानीत्युपधारय।।",
  "transliteration": "yathākāśasthito nityaṁ vāyuḥ sarvatra-go mahān |\ntathā sarvāṇi bhūtāni mat-sthānīty upadhāraya ||",
  "translation": "Just as the mighty wind, moving everywhere, always rests in space, know that in the same manner all beings rest in Me.",
  "commentary": "Krishna provides a beautiful analogy to help Arjuna understand the relationship between the Divine and creation. Just as the all-pervading wind, despite its constant movement throughout the universe, always remains within and supported by space (ākāśa), similarly all beings exist within the Divine consciousness. The wind never exists outside of space, yet space remains unaffected by the wind's movements. This illustrates the paradox of divine immanence and transcendence - God pervades all creation while remaining untouched by it.\n\nThis verse addresses the apparent contradiction presented in the previous verse where Krishna stated that all beings exist in Him, yet He does not exist in them. The analogy clarifies that beings depend entirely on the Divine for their existence, just as wind depends on space, but the Divine remains independent and unaffected by the qualities and actions of beings. This relationship is one of complete dependence on one side and complete independence on the other.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding the nature of divine omnipresence without contamination. Krishna is establishing the Vedantic principle that Brahman is both the material and efficient cause of the universe, yet remains untouched by worldly attributes. This verse encourages the spiritual aspirant to recognize that while we exist within the Divine, our actions and limitations do not affect the infinite nature of God, just as the turbulence of wind does not disturb the nature of space itself.",
