  "transliteration": "balaṁ balavatāṁ cāhaṁ kāma-rāga-vivarjitam|\ndharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kāmo'smi bharatarṣabha||",
  "translation": "I am the strength of the strong, devoid of desire and attachment. In all beings, I am the desire which is not contrary to dharma, O best of the Bharatas.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to reveal how He manifests in various aspects of creation. He declares that He is the strength present in the strong, but specifically the strength that is free from selfish desire (kāma) and passionate attachment (rāga). This indicates that true strength is not mere physical power used for selfish ends, but power exercised with detachment and for righteous purposes.\n\nThe second part of the verse is particularly significant as Krishna identifies Himself with desire (kāma) that is in accordance with dharma (righteousness). This is a crucial teaching that distinguishes between legitimate desires and those driven by selfish passion. Desires that align with one's duties, that support family life, procreation, and social welfare are not condemned. What is rejected is desire that violates dharmic principles—desire driven by lust, greed, and attachment that leads one away from righteousness. This verse thus establishes that not all desires are obstacles to spiritual progress; rather, it is the quality and direction of desire that matters.\n\nThis teaching fits within Chapter 7's broader theme of understanding God's manifestations in the world. Krishna is showing that even in seemingly worldly qualities like strength and desire, the Divine presence can be found when these are aligned with dharma. This helps the spiritual aspirant recognize the sacred in daily life and understand that renunciation does not mean rejection of all worldly engagement, but rather the purification of one's motivations and actions.",
