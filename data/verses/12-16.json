  "translation": "One who is free from desires, pure, expert, unconcerned, untroubled, and who has renounced all undertakings—such a devotee of Mine is dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate the qualities of His ideal devotee. The devotee described here possesses six essential characteristics: anapekṣaḥ (free from expectations), śuciḥ (pure in body and mind), dakṣaḥ (skillful and efficient in action), udāsīnaḥ (indifferent to worldly affairs), gata-vyathaḥ (free from anxiety and distress), and sarvārambha-parityāgī (one who has renounced the sense of doership in all undertakings). These qualities represent a state of inner freedom where the devotee acts in the world without being bound by personal desires or the fruits of action.\n\nThe term sarvārambha-parityāgī is particularly significant—it does not mean abandoning all action, but rather renouncing the ego-driven motivation behind actions. Such a devotee performs their duties skillfully (dakṣa) but without attachment to outcomes or identification with being the doer. This state of being 'unconcerned' (udāsīna) refers to maintaining equanimity amidst life's dualities, not to indifference toward one's responsibilities. The purity (śuci) mentioned encompasses both external cleanliness and internal purity of thought and intention. When these qualities are combined with devotion to the Divine, the practitioner becomes supremely dear to Krishna, as they embody the perfect integration of karma yoga (selfless action) and bhakti yoga (devotion).",
