  "transliteration": "kiṁ karma kim akarmeti kavayo 'py atra mohitāḥ |\ntat te karma pravakṣyāmi yaj jñātvā mokṣyase 'śubhāt ||",
  "translation": "What is action and what is inaction? Even the wise are confused about this. Therefore, I shall explain to you the nature of action, knowing which you shall be liberated from all evil.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna acknowledges the profound complexity surrounding the nature of action (karma) and inaction (akarma). He states that even the wise and learned (kavayas) have been bewildered by this subtle philosophical question. This confusion arises because action and inaction are not merely physical states but involve deeper metaphysical dimensions related to intention, attachment, and consciousness. The verse serves as a prelude to Krishna's detailed exposition on the true nature of karma.\n\nKrishna promises to clarify this confusion for Arjuna by explaining the real nature of action. The significance lies in understanding that liberation (moksha) from inauspiciousness or evil (ashubha) comes through proper knowledge of action. This sets up the following verses where Krishna will distinguish between action (karma), inaction (akarma), and prohibited action (vikarma). The verse emphasizes that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient; one needs divine wisdom to comprehend the subtle workings of karma and its relationship to spiritual freedom. This teaching is central to the Gita's message of karma yoga, where action performed with proper understanding becomes a means to liberation rather than bondage.",
