  "sanskrit": "यथा नदीनां बहवोऽम्बुवेगाः समुद्रमेवाभिमुखा द्रवन्ति ।\nतथा तवामी नरलोकवीरा विशन्ति वक्त्राण्यभिविज्वलन्ति ॥",
  "transliteration": "yathā nadīnāṁ bahavo'mbuvegāḥ samudram evābhimukhā dravanti |\ntathā tavāmī naralokavīrā viśanti vaktrāṇy abhivijvalanti ||",
  "translation": "As the many torrents of rivers flow toward the ocean, so do these heroes of the world of men enter Your blazing mouths.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to describe the terrifying vision of the Universal Form, using a powerful simile to convey the inexorable nature of destiny. Just as countless rivers, driven by their natural course, inevitably flow toward the ocean, so too do the great warriors assembled on the battlefield rush helplessly into the flaming mouths of Krishna's cosmic form. The comparison emphasizes the unstoppable force of time and destiny that Krishna represents.\n\nThe imagery is particularly striking because it combines the natural, inevitable flow of rivers with the violent destruction represented by the blazing mouths. This suggests that death and destruction, while appearing terrible from the human perspective, are as natural and inevitable as rivers flowing to the sea. The warriors, despite being described as 'heroes' (naralokavīrā), are powerless before this cosmic force, highlighting the ultimate futility of human pride and martial prowess in the face of divine will.\n\nThis verse reinforces the central teaching of this chapter: that Krishna is the supreme controller of time and destiny, and that all events in the material world, including the great battle of Kurukshetra, are already determined by divine will. It prepares Arjuna to understand his role as merely an instrument in the divine plan, a theme that Krishna will explicitly state in subsequent verses.",
