  "sanskrit": "ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्था मध्ये तिष्ठन्ति राजसाः |\nजघन्यगुणवृत्तिस्था अधो गच्छन्ति तामसाः ||१८||",
  "transliteration": "ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ |\njaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ ||18||",
  "translation": "Those established in sattva (goodness) go upward; those of rajas (passion) remain in the middle; and those situated in tamas (ignorance), abiding in the functions of the lowest guna, go downward.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the destinies that await individuals based on their predominant guna. Krishna explains the vertical hierarchy of spiritual evolution determined by the three modes of material nature. Those established in sattva-guna ascend to higher planes of existence—the celestial realms or higher births conducive to spiritual advancement. The rajasic individuals, driven by passion and desire for worldly achievements, remain in the middle realm, taking birth again in the human world where action and ambition dominate. The tamasic persons, engrossed in ignorance, delusion, and inertia, descend to lower states of existence, including subhuman species or hellish conditions.\n\nThis verse reinforces the teaching that one's consciousness at the time of death, shaped by lifelong habits and predominant qualities, determines the next birth. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating sattva-guna as a stepping stone toward transcendence. However, Krishna's ultimate teaching in the Gita is to go beyond all three gunas (traiguṇya) and attain the transcendental state. This verse serves as both a warning about the consequences of tamasic living and an encouragement to elevate one's consciousness through sattvic practices, while keeping the ultimate goal of transcendence in view.",
