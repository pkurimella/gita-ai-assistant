  "translation": "I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain. I am immortality and also death, O Arjuna, and I am being (sat) as well as non-being (asat).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals His cosmic functions and all-encompassing nature. He declares Himself as the controller of natural phenomena - providing the sun's heat (tapāmi) and regulating the rainfall by withholding or releasing it. These represent His governance over the fundamental elements that sustain life on earth. Beyond physical phenomena, Krishna identifies Himself with the ultimate metaphysical opposites: immortality (amṛta) and death (mṛtyu), representing His transcendence over the cycle of life and death.\n\nThe most profound declaration comes in the final phrase where Krishna states He is both sat (being, existence, reality) and asat (non-being, non-existence, unreality). This points to the Vedantic understanding that the Supreme Reality is beyond all dualities and encompasses all possibilities. Sat refers to the manifest, eternal reality, while asat can refer to the unmanifest potential or the temporary phenomenal world. This verse emphasizes that nothing exists outside of Krishna's essential nature - He is the substratum of all existence and non-existence.\n\nThis teaching is central to Chapter 9's theme of royal knowledge (rāja-vidyā), as it reveals the most comprehensive understanding of the Divine - that the Supreme Being is not merely a creator separate from creation, but the very essence of all that is and all that is not. This realization leads to complete surrender and devotion, as one understands that everything, including oneself, exists within the Divine consciousness.",
