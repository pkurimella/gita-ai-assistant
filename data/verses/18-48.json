  "transliteration": "sahajaṁ karma kaunteya sadoṣam api na tyajet|\nsarvārambhā hi doṣeṇa dhūmenāgnir ivāvṛtāḥ||",
  "translation": "One should not abandon one's natural duty, O son of Kunti, even if it is faulty. Indeed, all undertakings are enveloped by defects, as fire is covered by smoke.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides crucial guidance on the nature of svadharma (one's natural duty) and the inevitability of imperfection in worldly action. He instructs Arjuna not to abandon his innate duty as a warrior, even if it appears to have faults or moral complications. The term 'sahaja karma' refers to the duties that arise naturally from one's inherent nature and social position, which in Arjuna's case is the dharma of a Kshatriya.\n\nKrishna uses a powerful analogy to illustrate his point: just as fire is naturally accompanied by smoke, all actions in the material world are inevitably accompanied by some degree of imperfection or fault. This does not mean one should abandon action altogether, but rather that one should perform one's prescribed duties with detachment and dedication, accepting that complete perfection in the material realm is impossible. The smoke does not negate the value and necessity of fire; similarly, minor defects do not invalidate the importance of performing one's natural duty.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18's discussion of renunciation and liberation. Krishna is clarifying that true renunciation does not mean abandoning one's responsibilities, but rather performing them without attachment to results. This verse reinforces the central message of Karma Yoga and provides practical wisdom for navigating the moral complexities of life while remaining on the spiritual path.",
