  "translation": "Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one whose senses are completely restrained from their objects in all respects—that person's wisdom is firmly established.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as a conclusive statement summarizing Krishna's teaching on sense control. Having explained through the previous verses the dangers of uncontrolled senses and the characteristics of the sthitaprajna (person of steady wisdom), Krishna now definitively declares that complete mastery over the senses is the hallmark of established wisdom. The address 'mahā-bāho' (mighty-armed) is significant, as Krishna reminds Arjuna that just as he possesses physical strength, he must also develop the inner strength to control his senses.\n\nThe phrase 'nigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ' (completely restrained in all respects) emphasizes total and comprehensive sense control, not partial or selective restraint. This doesn't mean suppression or denial of the senses, but rather their proper regulation and direction away from objects that disturb mental equilibrium. The verse establishes a direct causal relationship between sense mastery and steady wisdom (prajñā pratiṣṭhitā).\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's practical philosophy. Krishna is not advocating for renunciation of action or withdrawal from the world, but rather for disciplined engagement where the senses serve the higher intelligence rather than enslaving it. This verse connects to the earlier description of the sthitaprajna and prepares the ground for the subsequent teachings on karma yoga, showing that wisdom and action must be grounded in self-mastery.",
