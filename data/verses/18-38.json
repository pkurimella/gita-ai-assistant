  "sanskrit": "विषयेन्द्रियसंयोगाद्यत्तदग्रेऽमृतोपमम्।\nपरिणामे विषमिव तत्सुखं राजसं स्मृतम्॥",
  "transliteration": "viṣayendriya-saṃyogād yat tad agre 'mṛtopamam |\npariṇāme viṣam iva tat sukhaṃ rājasaṃ smṛtam ||",
  "translation": "That pleasure which arises from the contact of the senses with their objects, which at first seems like nectar but in the end is like poison—such happiness is said to be rajasic.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the nature of rajasic (passionate) happiness, which is the second of the three types of happiness being categorized according to the three gunas. This pleasure is characterized by its deceptive nature—it appears extremely attractive and sweet like nectar (amrita) in the beginning when the senses first contact their desired objects, but ultimately transforms into something harmful like poison in its consequences.\n\nThe rajasic happiness arises from viṣayendriya-saṃyoga, the union of sense organs with sense objects. This includes all forms of sensory gratification—taste, touch, sight, sound, and smell. While such pleasures provide immediate satisfaction and excitement, they lead to negative consequences over time: addiction, dependency, dissatisfaction, restlessness, and eventual suffering. The initial euphoria gives way to craving, anxiety about loss, and the need for ever-increasing stimulation. This type of happiness keeps one bound to the cycle of desire and attachment, preventing spiritual progress.\n\nThis verse is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 18's discussion of renunciation and the three gunas. Krishna is helping Arjuna understand that not all happiness is equal or desirable. By recognizing the ultimately poisonous nature of rajasic pleasure, a spiritual seeker can develop discrimination (viveka) and turn toward sattvic happiness, which though initially requiring effort, leads to lasting peace and ultimately to the transcendent bliss beyond all three gunas.",
