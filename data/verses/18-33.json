  "transliteration": "dhṛtyā yayā dhārayate manaḥ-prāṇendriya-kriyāḥ |\nyogenāvyabhicāriṇyā dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī ||",
  "translation": "The unwavering determination by which one controls the activities of the mind, life-force, and senses through yoga practice—that determination, O Partha, is of the nature of sattva (goodness).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes sattvic determination (dhṛti), continuing his analysis of the three gunas as they manifest in different aspects of human psychology and behavior. Sattvic determination is characterized by its steadiness and unwavering nature (avyabhicāriṇī), through which a practitioner maintains control over three crucial domains: the mind (manas), the vital life-forces (prāṇa), and the senses (indriya). This control is achieved through yoga, indicating a disciplined spiritual practice rather than mere willpower.\n\nThe key feature of sattvic determination is its consistency and single-pointed focus. Unlike rajasic determination which wavers based on desires for results, or tamasic determination which clings to delusion, sattvic dhṛti remains steady in the pursuit of self-realization. It enables the practitioner to harmonize the mental, vital, and sensory functions, directing them toward the highest goal. This verse emphasizes that true spiritual progress requires not just occasional effort but sustained, unwavering determination that integrates all aspects of one's being—thought, breath, and sensory experience—into a unified yogic practice. Such determination is essential for maintaining the path of dharma and ultimately achieving liberation.",
