  "sanskrit": "श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप।\nसर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "śreyān dravyamayād yajñāj jñāna-yajñaḥ parantapa |\nsarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate ||",
  "translation": "Superior to the sacrifice of material objects is the sacrifice of knowledge, O scorcher of foes. All actions in their entirety, O Partha, culminate in knowledge.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the supremacy of jñāna-yajña (the sacrifice of knowledge) over dravya-yajña (material sacrifices). While material sacrifices involving offerings of grains, ghee, and other substances have their value, the pursuit and sharing of spiritual knowledge is considered far superior. This is because material sacrifices are limited by the finite nature of physical objects, whereas knowledge has infinite potential to transform consciousness and liberate the soul.\n\nKrishna then reveals a profound truth: all actions, when performed with proper understanding and attitude, ultimately culminate in knowledge (jñāna). This means that karma (action) and jñāna (knowledge) are not separate paths but interconnected aspects of spiritual evolution. Every action, when done with awareness and dedication, becomes a stepping stone toward self-realization. The verse suggests that the ultimate purpose of all ritualistic and worldly activities is to lead the practitioner toward the highest wisdom—the knowledge of the Self and the Supreme Reality. This understanding bridges the apparent gap between the path of action (karma yoga) and the path of knowledge (jñāna yoga), showing that they converge at the highest level of spiritual attainment.",
