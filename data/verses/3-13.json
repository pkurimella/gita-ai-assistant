  "translation": "The righteous who eat the remnants of sacrifice are freed from all sins, but those sinful ones who cook food only for their own sake, verily eat sin.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes the spiritual and ethical distinction between those who live in harmony with the cosmic order and those who live selfishly. Krishna explains that those who partake of food that has been first offered in sacrifice (yajña-śiṣṭa) are purified of all sins. This refers not merely to ritual offerings, but to the attitude of offering one's actions and their fruits to the Divine before enjoying them. Such people, being santo (righteous or saintly), understand that they are part of an interconnected web of existence and receive only what remains after fulfilling their duties to the gods, ancestors, and society.\n\nIn contrast, those who prepare food solely for their own gratification (ātma-kāraṇāt) without any sense of offering or duty are described as sinful. They accumulate papa (sin) because they violate the fundamental principle of yajña that Krishna has been establishing in the previous verses. This selfishness breaks the cycle of reciprocity and mutual sustenance that maintains cosmic and social harmony. The verse emphasizes that even the simple act of eating can be either spiritually elevating or degrading, depending on one's consciousness and attitude. This teaching is central to Karma Yoga, where every action, including the most mundane, becomes a means of spiritual purification when performed with the right understanding and intention.",
