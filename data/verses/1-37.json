  "sanskrit": "यद्यप्येते न पश्यन्ति लोभोपहतचेतसः।\nकुलक्षयकृतं दोषं मित्रद्रोहे च पातकम्॥",
  "transliteration": "yady apy ete na paśyanti lobhopahata-cetasaḥ |\nkula-kṣaya-kṛtaṃ doṣaṃ mitra-drohe ca pātakam ||",
  "translation": "Even though these men, with minds overpowered by greed, see no wrong in the destruction of the family and no sin in treachery to friends,",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna acknowledges that his opponents, the Kauravas, are blinded by greed and ambition. Their consciousness has been so corrupted by desire for power and wealth that they cannot perceive the grave sins they are committing—the destruction of the family lineage (kula-kṣaya) and betrayal of friends and relatives. Arjuna recognizes that Duryodhana and his allies have lost their moral compass due to their overwhelming greed (lobha).\n\nHowever, Arjuna is setting up a contrast here. He is essentially arguing that even though the Kauravas cannot see the evil in their actions due to their clouded judgment, he himself can clearly see the consequences. This verse leads directly to the next, where Arjuna questions why he and his brothers, who can see the sin clearly, should proceed with this war. This represents Arjuna's moral reasoning and his attempt to justify his reluctance to fight. He is distinguishing between those who act in ignorance and those who act with full knowledge of the consequences, suggesting that the latter bear greater responsibility.",
