  "sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच\nइत्यर्जुनं वासुदेवस्तथोक्त्वा स्वकं रूपं दर्शयामास भूयः।\nआश्वासयामास च भीतमेनं भूत्वा पुनः सौम्यवपुर्महात्मा॥",
  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\nity arjunaṁ vāsudevas tathoktvā svakaṁ rūpaṁ darśayām āsa bhūyaḥ |\nāśvāsayām āsa ca bhītam enaṁ bhūtvā punaḥ saumya-vapur mahātmā ||",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Vasudeva (Krishna) again revealed His own form. The Great Soul, assuming once more His gentle form, consoled the frightened Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial transition in Chapter 11, as Sanjaya narrates to Dhritarashtra the conclusion of the cosmic vision. After showing Arjuna the terrifying Universal Form (Vishvarupa), Krishna mercifully returns to His familiar, gentle human form. The verse emphasizes Krishna's compassion—He not only withdraws the overwhelming vision but actively consoles (āśvāsayām āsa) the frightened Arjuna.\n\nThe term 'mahātmā' (Great Soul) is significant here, indicating that despite appearing in a gentle, human form, Krishna's divine nature remains unchanged. The word 'saumya-vapu' (gentle form) contrasts sharply with the terrible cosmic form just witnessed, highlighting the relief Arjuna must have felt. This demonstrates an important theological principle: the Supreme Reality can manifest in forms appropriate to the devotee's capacity to receive divine grace.\n\nThis verse also serves as Sanjaya's commentary on the events, reminding us that this entire vision and dialogue is being narrated to the blind king Dhritarashtra. The return to Krishna's familiar form prepares the ground for the subsequent verses where Krishna will explain the significance of what Arjuna has witnessed and the means to attain divine vision.",
