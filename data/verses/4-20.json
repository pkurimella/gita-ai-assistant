  "sanskrit": "त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः।\nकर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः॥",
  "transliteration": "tyaktvā karma-phalāsaṅgaṁ nitya-tṛpto nirāśrayaḥ |\nkarmaṇy abhipravṛtto 'pi naiva kiñcit karoti saḥ ||",
  "translation": "Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of action, ever content, depending on nothing, though engaged in action, such a person does nothing at all.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of a karma-yogi who has attained true wisdom. Though such a person may appear to be actively engaged in various activities, they are in reality performing no action in the binding sense. This paradox is resolved by understanding that action binds only when performed with attachment to results and identification with doership. The enlightened person has abandoned all attachment to the fruits of action (karma-phala-āsaṅga) and remains ever satisfied (nitya-tṛpta) in the Self, requiring no external support or validation (nirāśraya).\n\nThe key teaching here is that physical activity does not constitute bondage; it is the mental attitude of attachment and ego-identification that creates karma. When one acts without desire for personal gain, without the sense of 'I am the doer,' and without dependence on outcomes, the actions become non-binding. Such a person lives in the world, performs duties, yet remains untouched by karmic consequences. This verse establishes the foundation for karma-yoga as a path to liberation, showing that renunciation is primarily internal rather than external. It is not the abandonment of action itself, but the abandonment of attachment and ego that constitutes true renunciation.",
