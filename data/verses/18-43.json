  "translation": "Heroism, vigor, firmness, resourcefulness, not fleeing from battle, generosity, and lordly conduct—these are the duties of a Kshatriya, born of his own nature.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the natural qualities and duties (svadharma) of the Kshatriya or warrior class. These qualities arise spontaneously from their inherent nature (svabhava) rather than being artificially imposed. The verse lists seven primary characteristics: courage (shaurya), brilliance or splendor (tejas), steadfastness (dhriti), skillfulness (dakshya), not retreating from battle (apalāyanam), generosity (dana), and lordly or leadership qualities (ishvara-bhava). These attributes define the warrior's role in maintaining social order and protecting dharma.\n\nThis verse is part of Krishna's larger discourse on the division of labor according to the three gunas and individual nature. By describing the Kshatriya dharma, Krishna reinforces to Arjuna that fighting in the righteous war is not merely his duty but an expression of his essential nature. The qualities mentioned are not just martial virtues but also include moral and spiritual dimensions like generosity and noble bearing. This comprehensive view of the warrior's role shows that true Kshatriya dharma involves both strength and compassion, power and responsibility. The emphasis on these duties being 'svabhava-jam' (born of one's own nature) underscores the Gita's teaching that following one's natural inclinations in accordance with dharma leads to both worldly effectiveness and spiritual progress.",
