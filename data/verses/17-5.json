  "transliteration": "aśāstra-vihitaṁ ghoraṁ tapyante ye tapo janāḥ |\ndambhāhaṅkāra-saṁyuktāḥ kāma-rāga-balānvitāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those who practice severe austerities not prescribed by the scriptures, motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, impelled by the force of desire and attachment...",
  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's description of tamasic (ignorant) austerity by identifying those who perform severe penances that are not sanctioned by scriptural authority. Such practitioners are driven by dambha (ostentation or hypocrisy), ahamkara (ego), and the powerful forces of kama (desire) and raga (attachment). These austerities are called 'ghora' (terrible or dreadful) because they are harmful rather than spiritually beneficial.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of following scriptural guidelines (shastra-vihita) in spiritual practice. When austerities are performed outside these guidelines and are motivated by ego, the desire for recognition, or attachment to results, they become counterproductive. Such practices may appear impressive externally but lack the inner purity and proper intention that make spiritual disciplines effective. This verse sets up the continuation in the next verse, which describes how such misguided austerities harm both the body and the indwelling Self.\n\nIn the broader context of Chapter 17, this verse illustrates how even seemingly spiritual practices like tapas (austerity) can be perverted when performed with the wrong motivation and without proper knowledge. It reinforces the Gita's consistent teaching that the quality of an action is determined not just by the action itself, but by the consciousness, intention, and understanding with which it is performed.",
