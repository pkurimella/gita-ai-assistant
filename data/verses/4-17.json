  "sanskrit": "कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः ।\nअकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः ॥१७॥",
  "transliteration": "karmaṇo hy api boddhavyaṁ boddhavyaṁ ca vikarmaṇaḥ |\nakarmaṇaś ca boddhavyaṁ gahanā karmaṇo gatiḥ ||17||",
  "translation": "The nature of action must be understood, the nature of wrong action must be understood, and the nature of inaction must also be understood. Profound and difficult to comprehend is the true nature of action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the complexity and subtlety of understanding action (karma). He identifies three distinct categories that must be comprehended: karma (right action or prescribed action), vikarma (wrong action or prohibited action), and akarma (inaction or actionlessness in action). This threefold classification is essential for spiritual progress, as confusion about these categories leads to bondage, while proper understanding leads to liberation.\n\nKrishna declares that the path of action is 'gahana' (profound, mysterious, difficult to fathom). This statement prepares Arjuna for the profound teaching that follows in the next verse - that one who can see inaction in action and action in inaction is truly wise. The difficulty lies not in performing actions themselves, but in understanding their true nature and performing them without attachment or ego-identification. Many spiritual seekers become confused about whether to act or renounce action, not realizing that the key lies in the attitude and understanding with which actions are performed, not merely in their performance or abandonment. This verse serves as a crucial foundation for understanding karma yoga and the relationship between action and knowledge in spiritual life.",
