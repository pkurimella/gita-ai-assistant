  "translation": "From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, one should restrain it and bring it back under the control of the Self alone.",
  "commentary": "This verse provides practical instruction for meditation practice, addressing the universal challenge faced by all practitioners—the wandering mind. Krishna acknowledges that the mind is naturally restless (chanchalam) and unsteady (asthiram), constantly moving from one object to another. The phrase 'yato yato' (from whatever and wherever) emphasizes that regardless of what distracts the mind—whether sensory objects, memories, plans, or emotions—the response should always be the same: gently but firmly bring it back to the Self.\n\nThe instruction 'tatas tato niyamya' (from there and there, restraining it) suggests a patient, repetitive process rather than a one-time effort. This verse reveals that meditation is not about achieving a permanently still mind immediately, but rather about developing the skill of repeatedly redirecting attention. Each time the practitioner notices the mind has wandered and brings it back, they strengthen their capacity for concentration. This process of noticing distraction and returning to the object of meditation is itself the practice, not a failure of practice.\n\nThe ultimate goal stated here is to bring the mind under the control of the Atman (Self). This represents the culmination of the meditation practice described throughout Chapter 6, where the individual consciousness merges with or rests in the supreme Self. The verse emphasizes self-reliance in spiritual practice—it is through one's own effort (atmani eva) that mastery over the mind is achieved. This teaching remains foundational to all meditation traditions that have emerged from yogic philosophy.",
