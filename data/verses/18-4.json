  "sanskrit": "निश्चयं शृणु मे तत्र त्यागे भरतसत्तम।\nत्यागो हि पुरुषव्याघ्र त्रिविधः सम्प्रकीर्तितः॥",
  "transliteration": "niścayaṁ śṛṇu me tatra tyāge bharatasattama |\ntyāgo hi puruṣavyāghra trividhaḥ samprakīrtitaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Hear from Me, O best of the Bharatas, My conclusive judgment regarding renunciation. O tiger among men, renunciation has been declared to be of three kinds.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna begins to provide His authoritative and definitive answer to Arjuna's question about the distinction between sannyāsa (renunciation of action) and tyāga (renunciation of the fruits of action). Krishna addresses Arjuna with affectionate epithets—'Bharatasattama' (best of the Bharatas) and 'puruṣavyāghra' (tiger among men)—indicating the importance of the teaching that follows and Arjuna's worthiness to receive it.\n\nKrishna announces that He will provide a 'niścaya' (conclusive or definitive judgment) on the matter of tyāga. This indicates that what follows is not mere opinion but the ultimate truth on this subject. By stating that tyāga is of three kinds (trividha), Krishna prepares to explain how renunciation manifests differently based on the three guṇas (qualities of nature)—sattva, rajas, and tamas. This classification will help Arjuna understand that not all forms of renunciation are equal or spiritually beneficial.\n\nThis verse serves as a transitional statement, moving from Arjuna's question to Krishna's systematic exposition. It establishes the framework for understanding that true renunciation is not simply abandoning action, but rather performing action without attachment to results. The threefold classification that Krishna promises to explain will provide practical guidance for spiritual seekers on how to practice proper renunciation while remaining engaged in their duties.",
