  "sanskrit": "गुणानेतानतीत्य त्रीन्देही देहसमुद्भवान् ।\nजन्ममृत्युजरादुःखैर्विमुक्तोऽमृतमश्नुते ॥",
  "transliteration": "guṇān etān atītya trīn dehī deha-samudbhavān |\njanma-mṛtyu-jarā-duḥkhair vimukto 'mṛtam aśnute ||",
  "translation": "When the embodied soul transcends these three gunas that originate from the body, it is freed from birth, death, old age, and sorrow, and attains immortality.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents the ultimate fruit of transcending the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas). Krishna declares that when the embodied soul (dehī) rises above these three fundamental qualities of material nature, which are the very source of physical embodiment, the soul becomes liberated from the entire cycle of material existence. The phrase 'deha-samudbhavān' (originating from the body) indicates that these gunas are intimately connected with material embodiment and are the root cause of bodily identification.\n\nThe liberation described here is comprehensive—freedom from birth (janma), death (mṛtyu), old age (jarā), and all forms of suffering (duḥkha). These four represent the complete spectrum of material bondage that afflicts all embodied beings in the cycle of saṃsāra. By transcending the gunas, one is no longer subject to the laws of material nature that govern embodiment and its inevitable consequences. The verse culminates with the promise of attaining immortality (amṛtam), which refers not merely to endless existence but to the realization of one's eternal, spiritual nature beyond the temporary material body.\n\nThis verse serves as a pivotal point in Chapter 14, transitioning from the theoretical understanding of the gunas to the practical possibility and result of transcending them. It provides the motivation for spiritual practice by clearly stating the ultimate goal—complete liberation from material bondage and the attainment of the immortal, blissful state of self-realization. This teaching reinforces the central message of the Gita that the soul's true nature is eternal and beyond material conditioning.",
