  "translation": "For one who is born, death is certain; and for one who has died, birth is certain. Therefore, in this unavoidable situation, you should not grieve.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents a fundamental truth of material existence to console Arjuna. He establishes the inevitability of the cycle of birth and death for all embodied beings. Whatever is born must die, and whatever dies must be born again according to the laws of karma and reincarnation. This is the inescapable nature of the phenomenal world.\n\nKrishna uses this argument to demonstrate that Arjuna's grief over the impending death of his relatives is ultimately futile. Since death is certain for all who are born, and rebirth is certain for all who die, mourning over what is inevitable serves no purpose. The word 'aparihārye' (unavoidable) emphasizes that this is not a situation that can be escaped through any worldly means.\n\nThis verse continues the philosophical instruction that began earlier in the chapter, where Krishna distinguishes between the eternal soul and the temporary body. By accepting the cyclical nature of birth and death as it applies to the body, while understanding the immortality of the soul, one can transcend grief and perform one's duty without attachment. This teaching is central to the Gita's message of karma yoga and equanimity in action.",
