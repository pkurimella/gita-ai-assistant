  "transliteration": "puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ pārtha bhaktyā labhyas tv ananyayā |\nyasyāntaḥsthāni bhūtāni yena sarvam idaṁ tatam ||22||",
  "translation": "That Supreme Purusha, O Partha (Arjuna), within whom all beings dwell and by whom all this universe is pervaded, is attainable only through unwavering devotion directed to Him alone.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the supreme means of attaining the highest reality—the Supreme Purusha. This Purusha is described as 'para' (supreme or transcendent), indicating that He is beyond all material manifestations and is the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit. Krishna emphasizes that this Supreme Being contains all beings within Himself (yasyāntaḥsthāni bhūtāni) and simultaneously pervades the entire universe (yena sarvam idaṁ tatam), presenting the paradox of divine immanence and transcendence.\n\nThe crucial teaching here is the method of attaining this Supreme Reality: ananyā bhakti—exclusive, undivided devotion. The word 'ananyā' (without another) signifies that the devotion must be single-pointed, without being divided among multiple objects or goals. This verse establishes bhakti (devotion) as the supreme means of realization, accessible to all regardless of their intellectual capacity or ritual qualifications. Unlike the complex yogic practices or the difficult paths described earlier in the chapter, devotion is presented as a direct and universal path.\n\nThis verse serves as a culmination of the chapter's teachings on various paths after death and methods of God-realization. While earlier verses discussed the knowledge of time cycles, the paths of light and darkness, and meditation techniques, Krishna now reveals that all these are ultimately transcended by pure devotion. The Supreme Purusha is both the container and the pervader, both immanent and transcendent, yet intimately accessible through love and devotion, making this one of the most compassionate and inclusive teachings of the Gita.",
