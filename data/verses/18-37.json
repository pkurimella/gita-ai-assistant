  "transliteration": "yat tad agre viṣam iva pariṇāme 'mṛtopamam |\ntat sukhaṁ sāttvikaṁ proktam ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam ||37||",
  "translation": "That happiness which appears like poison in the beginning but is like nectar in the end, born from the clarity of one's own intellect and self-realization—that is declared to be sattvic happiness.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes sattvic (pure) happiness, which is the first of three types of happiness he will explain. This happiness is characterized by a reversal of immediate gratification—it appears unpleasant or difficult at first, like poison, but transforms into nectar-like bliss in its culmination. This initial difficulty arises because sattvic happiness requires discipline, self-control, meditation, and the pursuit of self-knowledge, all of which demand effort and sacrifice of immediate pleasures.\n\nThe key phrase 'ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam' reveals the source of this happiness: it is born from the serene clarity of the purified intellect engaged in self-realization. Unlike sensory pleasures that depend on external objects, sattvic happiness arises from within, from the understanding of one's true nature. This happiness is sustainable and leads to spiritual growth, as it is rooted in wisdom rather than fleeting sensory experiences. The verse emphasizes that true and lasting happiness requires initial effort and discipline, much like the practice of yoga and meditation which may seem arduous initially but yield profound peace and joy.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in Chapter 18's context of renunciation and liberation, as it guides the seeker to distinguish between temporary pleasures and lasting fulfillment. Krishna encourages Arjuna to pursue the path that leads to genuine well-being, even if it requires initial struggle, rather than seeking immediate gratification that ultimately leads to suffering.",
