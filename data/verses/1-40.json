  "transliteration": "adharmābhibhavāt kṛṣṇa praduṣyanti kulastriyaḥ |\nstrīṣu duṣṭāsu vārṣṇeya jāyate varṇasaṅkaraḥ ||",
  "translation": "When irreligion prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted; and when women are corrupted, O descendant of Vrishni, there arises an unwanted progeny (intermixing of castes).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his argument against fighting the war by expressing his concern about the social consequences of killing the family elders. He addresses Krishna by two names - Krishna and Vārṣṇeya (descendant of Vrishni) - showing both intimacy and respect. Arjuna argues that when dharma is destroyed and adharma prevails, the family structure breaks down, leading to the corruption of women who are traditionally seen as the guardians of family values and culture.\n\nArjuna's concern reflects the social thinking of his time, where the purity of family lineage and the maintenance of social order (varna system) were considered essential for societal stability. He fears that the death of the elder guardians would lead to a breakdown of moral and social codes, resulting in varṇasaṅkara (intermixing of castes), which was believed to lead to social chaos. This verse reveals Arjuna's deep anxiety about the far-reaching consequences of the war beyond just the immediate violence.\n\nWhile this verse reflects the social concerns and values of ancient Indian society, it serves a larger purpose in the Gita's narrative structure. Arjuna's arguments, though appearing logical and compassionate on the surface, are rooted in confusion about his duty and attachment to outcomes. Krishna will later address these concerns by teaching about dharma, detachment, and the eternal nature of the soul, helping Arjuna transcend his limited perspective and understand his true duty as a warrior.",
