  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection",
  "sanskrit": "सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये रथं स्थापय मेऽच्युत ।\nयावदेतान्निरीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकामानवस्थितान् ॥",
  "transliteration": "senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me'cyuta |\nyāvad etān nirīkṣe'haṁ yoddhu-kāmān avasthitān ||",
  "translation": "O Acyuta (Krishna), please place my chariot between the two armies, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous of battle, and with whom I must engage in this act of war.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'Acyuta' (the infallible one) and requests Him to position his chariot in the middle of the battlefield. This request reveals Arjuna's initial confidence and warrior spirit as he wishes to survey the opposing forces before the battle commences. He wants to see clearly who has assembled with the desire to fight, indicating his readiness to assess his opponents and prepare for combat.\n\nThis verse is significant as it sets the stage for Arjuna's subsequent moral crisis. His request to view the warriors is not merely tactical but becomes the catalyst for his emotional breakdown. When he actually sees his relatives, teachers, and friends arrayed for battle, his initial warrior resolve will crumble, leading to the profound spiritual discourse that forms the essence of the Bhagavad Gita. The irony is palpable—Arjuna's confident request to survey his enemies becomes the very means by which his determination is shattered.\n\nThe use of 'Acyuta' (the infallible) is also noteworthy, as Arjuna places complete trust in Krishna's ability to position the chariot perfectly. This epithet foreshadows Krishna's role not just as a charioteer but as the infallible guide who will lead Arjuna from darkness to light, from confusion to clarity, through the teachings that follow.",
