  "translation": "In the beginning, the Creator, having created mankind along with sacrifice, said: 'By this shall you multiply; let this be the fulfiller of your desires.'",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces the cosmic principle of yajna (sacrifice) as established at the very beginning of creation. Lord Krishna explains that Prajapati (Brahma, the Creator) instituted sacrifice as an integral part of the created order, making it the means by which humanity would prosper and fulfill its needs. The term 'saha-yajñāḥ' indicates that humans were created together with the spirit of sacrifice, suggesting that selfless action and mutual cooperation are inherent to human nature and purpose.\n\nThe verse establishes that yajna is not merely a ritual but a fundamental law of existence—a principle of giving and receiving that sustains the cosmic order. By performing actions in the spirit of sacrifice (offering one's efforts for the welfare of all rather than selfish gain), humanity can prosper materially and spiritually. The phrase 'iṣṭa-kāma-dhuk' (the fulfiller of desires) indicates that when actions are performed as yajna, they become like the celestial wish-fulfilling cow (Kamadhenu), granting legitimate desires while maintaining dharmic balance.\n\nThis teaching is central to Karma Yoga as it transforms ordinary action into spiritual practice. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that action performed as sacrifice, without selfish attachment, leads to both worldly prosperity and spiritual liberation. This verse lays the foundation for the subsequent verses that elaborate on the interconnected cycle of sacrifice involving humans, devas, and nature.",
