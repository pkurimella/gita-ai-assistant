  "translation": "Of all yogis, the one who abides in Me with great faith, worshipping Me with his inner self absorbed in Me—that yogi I consider to be the most united with Me in yoga.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of the sixth chapter establishes the supremacy of bhakti yoga (the yoga of devotion) over all other forms of yoga. Krishna declares that among all practitioners of yoga—whether they practice karma yoga, jnana yoga, dhyana yoga, or any other spiritual discipline—the greatest is the one whose inner consciousness (antaratma) is completely absorbed in the Divine and who worships with unwavering faith (shraddha). This verse synthesizes the entire teaching of the chapter on meditation by revealing that the ultimate goal of all yogic practices is loving devotion to the Supreme.\n\nThe phrase 'mad-gatena antaratmana' (with inner self absorbed in Me) indicates that true yoga is not merely external practice or mechanical meditation, but a complete inner transformation where one's consciousness becomes unified with the Divine. The word 'shraddavan' (endowed with faith) emphasizes that this devotion must be accompanied by genuine faith and love, not mere ritualistic worship. Krishna uses the superlative 'yuktatamah' (most united) to indicate that this devotional yogi has achieved the highest state of union possible.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant as it provides the transition from the technical practices of meditation discussed throughout Chapter 6 to the revelation of divine knowledge in Chapter 7. It establishes that while various yogic disciplines have their place and value, the path of loving devotion combined with inner absorption in the Divine represents the culmination of all spiritual practices. This teaching reconciles the apparently different paths of yoga by showing that they all ultimately lead to and find their fulfillment in bhakti—wholehearted devotion to the Supreme Reality.",
