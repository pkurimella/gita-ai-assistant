  "translation": "Having attained Me, the great souls who have reached the highest perfection do not incur rebirth, which is the temporary abode of misery.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the supreme benefit of reaching Him—liberation from the cycle of birth and death. He characterizes the material world as 'duḥkhālayam' (abode of suffering) and 'aśāśvatam' (temporary/impermanent), emphasizing the inherent limitations of worldly existence. Even the highest material attainments are temporary and mixed with suffering. The 'mahātmānaḥ' (great souls) are those who have perfected themselves through yoga and devotion, transcending material consciousness entirely.\n\nThis verse establishes the ultimate goal of spiritual practice—not merely attaining higher planetary systems or temporary heavenly pleasures, but complete liberation (mokṣa) through union with the Supreme. Those who reach Krishna's eternal abode never return to material existence. The term 'saṁsiddhim paramām' indicates the highest perfection or complete spiritual accomplishment, which is qualitatively different from all material achievements, however elevated they may be.\n\nThe verse serves as a pivotal statement in Chapter 8, contrasting the permanent spiritual destination with temporary material worlds described in subsequent verses. It reinforces the central teaching of the Gita that the ultimate purpose of human life is to transcend the cycle of saṁsāra and attain eternal communion with the Divine, thereby ending all suffering permanently.",
