  "translation": "But those who, finding fault with My teaching, do not follow it, know them to be deluded in all knowledge, devoid of discrimination, and lost.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the stark consequences of rejecting the path of selfless action (karma yoga) that He has been teaching. After explaining in the previous verse the benefits of following His teaching, Krishna now warns against the opposite course. Those who criticize or cavil at His doctrine out of envy or ego, and refuse to practice it, are described with three damning characteristics: they are deluded in all knowledge (sarvajñānavimūḍha), lacking in discrimination (acetasa), and ultimately lost or ruined (naṣṭa).\n\nThe verse emphasizes that mere intellectual knowledge without practical application and faith is worthless. Those who find fault (abhyasūyanta) with the teaching are not genuine seekers but critics motivated by ego and resistance. Their delusion is comprehensive—affecting all their knowledge—because they reject the fundamental principle of dharmic action. The term 'acetasa' (devoid of discrimination) indicates they lack the viveka or discernment to recognize truth when presented to them. This verse serves as a warning within the chapter on Karma Yoga, highlighting that the path requires not just understanding but also faith, humility, and sincere practice. The consequence of rejection is spiritual ruin (naṣṭa), meaning they remain bound in the cycle of ignorance and suffering, unable to progress toward liberation.",
