  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, in this world a twofold path has been declared by Me in ancient times—the path of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) for the contemplative, and the path of action (Karma Yoga) for the active.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna responds to Arjuna's confusion expressed in the previous verse regarding whether knowledge or action is superior. Krishna clarifies that there are two distinct spiritual paths suited to different temperaments and dispositions. The path of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) is meant for the Sankhyas—those of contemplative nature who are inclined toward philosophical inquiry and meditation. The path of action (Karma Yoga) is for the Yogis—those who are active by nature and find spiritual fulfillment through selfless service and dedicated action.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that these paths were established 'in ancient times' (purā), indicating that this is not a new teaching but an eternal truth rooted in Vedic wisdom. By addressing Arjuna as 'anagha' (sinless), Krishna reassures him and creates a receptive atmosphere for understanding. The key insight here is that both paths lead to the same ultimate goal of liberation, but they are suited to different psychological constitutions. This verse sets the foundation for the rest of Chapter 3, where Krishna will elaborate on Karma Yoga and explain why action is necessary, especially for those who have worldly duties and responsibilities like Arjuna.",
