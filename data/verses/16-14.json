  "sanskrit": "असौ मया हतः शत्रुर्हनिष्ये चापरानपि |\nईश्वरोऽहमहं भोगी सिद्धोऽहं बलवान्सुखी ||१४||",
  "transliteration": "asau mayā hataḥ śatrur haniṣye cāparān api |\nīśvaro'ham ahaṁ bhogī siddho'haṁ balavān sukhī ||14||",
  "translation": "That enemy has been slain by me, and I shall slay others too. I am the lord, I am the enjoyer, I am successful, powerful, and happy.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of the demoniac mentality by presenting the arrogant inner dialogue of such persons. The verse reveals the egotistical self-perception of those possessed by asuric qualities. They boast about destroying their enemies and express their intention to eliminate others as well, showing their violent and vengeful nature. Their proclamation 'I am the lord' (īśvaro'ham) demonstrates their complete delusion, as they usurp the position that belongs only to the Supreme. They consider themselves the ultimate enjoyer (bhogī), completely successful (siddha), powerful (balavān), and happy (sukhī).\n\nThis verse is significant in the context of Chapter 16 as it illustrates the psychological state of those with demoniac qualities. The repeated use of 'aham' (I) emphasizes the extreme egoism that characterizes such individuals. They are completely self-centered, viewing themselves as the center of the universe, the ultimate authority, and the supreme enjoyer of all pleasures. This delusion prevents them from recognizing the Divine, understanding dharma, or developing any spiritual qualities. Their happiness is superficial and based entirely on material success, power over others, and sensory gratification. Krishna presents this description so that Arjuna (and all seekers) can recognize and avoid such tendencies, understanding that true fulfillment comes not from ego-inflation but from surrender to the Divine and cultivation of divine qualities.",
