  "transliteration": "naite sṛtī pārtha jānan yogī muhyati kaścana |\ntasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu yoga-yukto bhavārjuna ||",
  "translation": "Knowing these two paths, O Partha, no yogi is ever deluded. Therefore, at all times, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga.",
  "commentary": "In this concluding verse of the discussion on the two paths—the bright path (śukla-mārga) leading to liberation and the dark path (kṛṣṇa-mārga) leading to return—Krishna emphasizes that a yogi who understands these paths is never confused about the goal or the means. This knowledge itself becomes a source of clarity and determination on the spiritual path. The verse serves as a synthesis of the teachings presented in this chapter about the different destinies that await souls after death based on their consciousness and spiritual practice.\n\nKrishna's instruction to 'be steadfast in yoga at all times' (sarveṣu kāleṣu yoga-yuktaḥ bhava) is the practical application of all the knowledge shared in this chapter. It is not enough to merely know about these paths intellectually; one must remain constantly united with the Divine through yoga practice. This constant union ensures that at the time of death, the practitioner's consciousness is naturally fixed on the Supreme, guaranteeing liberation rather than return to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe use of 'Arjuna' at the end is significant, as Krishna addresses him by name to emphasize the personal and urgent nature of this instruction. This verse bridges the theoretical knowledge of paths after death with the practical necessity of consistent spiritual discipline throughout life. It underscores that liberation is not a matter of chance but of conscious, continuous effort in maintaining yogic awareness.",
