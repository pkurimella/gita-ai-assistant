  "sanskrit": "पाञ्चजन्यं हृषीकेशो देवदत्तं धनञ्जयः।\nपौण्ड्रं दध्मौ महाशङ्खं भीमकर्मा वृकोदरः॥",
  "transliteration": "pāñcajanyaṁ hṛṣīkeśo devadattaṁ dhanañjayaḥ |\npauṇḍraṁ dadhmau mahāśaṅkhaṁ bhīmakarmā vṛkodaraḥ ||",
  "translation": "Hrishikesha (Krishna) blew the Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew the Devadatta, and Vrikodara (Bhima), the doer of terrible deeds, blew the great conch Paundra.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues the description of the conch-blowing ceremony that marks the commencement of the great battle. Krishna, referred to here as Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), blows his famous conch Panchajanya. Arjuna, called Dhananjaya (the winner of wealth), sounds his conch Devadatta (God-given). Bhima, known as Vrikodara (wolf-bellied, indicating his enormous appetite) and described as 'bhīmakarmā' (doer of terrible deeds), blows his mighty conch Paundra.\n\nThe naming of each warrior with their epithets is significant. Krishna is called Hrishikesha, emphasizing his divine nature as the controller of all senses, foreshadowing his role as Arjuna's charioteer and guide. Arjuna is called Dhananjaya, reminding us of his prowess as a warrior who has won great wealth through conquest. Bhima's epithet 'bhīmakarmā' recalls his fearsome strength and his past terrible deeds against the Kauravas. Each conch has its own name, suggesting the uniqueness and glory of each warrior. This verse establishes the presence and readiness of the key Pandava warriors, setting the stage for the impending conflict and the subsequent dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna that forms the heart of the Bhagavad Gita.",
