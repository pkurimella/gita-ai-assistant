  "sanskrit": "समं कायशिरोग्रीवं धारयन्नचलं स्थिरः।\nसम्प्रेक्ष्य नासिकाग्रं स्वं दिशश्चानवलोकयन्॥",
  "transliteration": "samaṁ kāya-śiro-grīvaṁ dhārayann acalaṁ sthiraḥ |\nsamprekṣya nāsikāgraṁ svaṁ diśaś cānavalokayan ||",
  "translation": "Holding the body, head, and neck erect and still, remaining firm and motionless, gazing at the tip of one's nose without looking around in any direction.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's detailed instructions on the proper physical posture for meditation. The emphasis is on maintaining perfect alignment of the body, head, and neck in a straight line, creating a stable foundation for deep meditation. The stillness and firmness mentioned here are not merely physical but also indicate mental steadiness. The practitioner should remain like a statue, unmoving and unwavering.\n\nThe instruction to gaze at the tip of the nose (nāsikāgra) is a classical yogic technique known as nāsikāgra dṛṣṭi. This does not mean straining the eyes to literally see the nose tip, but rather maintaining a gentle, downward gaze that naturally falls in that direction. This technique serves multiple purposes: it prevents the eyes from wandering and becoming distracted by external objects, it helps internalize awareness, and it aids in concentration. The phrase 'without looking around in any direction' reinforces the need for complete withdrawal from external distractions.\n\nIn the broader context of Chapter 6, this verse is part of Krishna's systematic teaching on dhyana yoga. After establishing the proper place and seat for meditation in previous verses, Krishna now addresses the precise physical alignment and visual focus required. This attention to detail demonstrates that successful meditation requires both external discipline and internal focus, with the physical posture serving as a foundation for mental concentration and ultimately spiritual realization.",
