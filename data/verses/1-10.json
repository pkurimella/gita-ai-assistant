  "commentary": "In this verse, Duryodhana continues his assessment of the military forces on both sides. He expresses a paradoxical view that despite having the great Bhishma as their commander, the Kaurava forces are 'aparyāpta' (insufficient or unlimited in some interpretations), while the Pandava army protected by Bhima is 'paryāpta' (sufficient or limited). This verse has been subject to various interpretations by commentators. Some scholars suggest Duryodhana is actually expressing anxiety despite his outward confidence, revealing his inner fear that even Bhishma's protection may not be enough against the Pandavas.\n\nThe verse reveals Duryodhana's psychological state at the beginning of the battle. Despite his attempts to boost morale by enumerating his warriors, he inadvertently expresses doubt about the outcome. The mention of Bhishma and Bhima as the respective protectors is significant - Bhishma represents the elder statesman bound by duty and vows, while Bhima represents raw martial power and righteous anger. This comparison foreshadows the complex dynamics of loyalty, duty, and righteousness that will be explored throughout the Gita. Duryodhana's words also demonstrate how even superior numbers and great warriors cannot guarantee victory when the cause itself is unjust.",
