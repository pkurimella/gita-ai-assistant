  "transliteration": "śreyān sva-dharmo viguṇaḥ para-dharmāt sv-anuṣṭhitāt |\nsvabhāva-niyataṁ karma kurvan nāpnoti kilbiṣam ||",
  "translation": "Better is one's own duty, though imperfectly performed, than the duty of another well performed. One who does the work ordained by one's own nature incurs no sin.",
  "commentary": "This verse emphasizes one of the central teachings of the Bhagavad Gita: the importance of following one's svadharma (own duty) rather than imitating another's path, however attractive it may appear. Krishna declares that it is better to perform one's own duty imperfectly (viguṇaḥ - deficient in qualities) than to perform another's duty perfectly (sv-anuṣṭhitāt - well-executed). This is because each person's dharma is aligned with their inherent nature (svabhāva) and the qualities (guṇas) that predominate in them.\n\nThe verse assures that when one performs actions that are natural to one's constitution and station in life, no sin or negative karma accrues, even if the performance is imperfect. This is because such action is in harmony with one's svabhāva (innate nature) and represents authentic self-expression rather than artificial imitation. This teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 18, which deals with renunciation and liberation, as it clarifies that true spiritual progress comes not from abandoning one's natural duties but from performing them with the right understanding and attitude.\n\nThis verse echoes the teaching from Chapter 3, verse 35, reinforcing its importance. In the broader context of the Gita's message to Arjuna, it validates his role as a warrior (kṣatriya) and encourages him to fulfill his dharma on the battlefield rather than adopting the path of renunciation that doesn't align with his nature. The philosophical significance lies in recognizing that liberation comes through authentic action aligned with one's true nature, not through imitation or escape from one's ordained responsibilities.",
