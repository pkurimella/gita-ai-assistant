  "translation": "One who thus knows in truth the divine nature of My birth and actions, upon leaving the body, is not born again but comes to Me, O Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "This verse reveals the profound spiritual benefit of understanding Krishna's divine incarnations and activities. Krishna declares that those who comprehend the transcendental nature (tattvatah) of His birth and deeds—that they are not material but divine (divyam)—attain liberation. Unlike ordinary beings bound by karma, Krishna's appearances are voluntary acts of grace, not compelled by past actions. His birth is not a result of karma but a conscious descent to restore dharma.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that mere intellectual knowledge is insufficient; one must know 'in truth' (tattvataḥ), meaning with complete realization and devotion. This understanding transforms consciousness, purifying the heart of material desires and karmic impressions. When such a devotee leaves the physical body, they transcend the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and attain Krishna's eternal abode. This is the ultimate goal of bhakti—union with the Divine.\n\nThis teaching is central to Chapter 4's theme of divine knowledge and action. It connects Krishna's earlier explanation of His avatara (divine descent) with the practical path to liberation. The verse assures seekers that understanding God's true nature—through study, devotion, and grace—is itself a means to moksha. It establishes that liberation is not merely through renunciation of action but through right knowledge combined with devotion to the Supreme.",
