  "sanskrit": "सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति ।\nवेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते ॥",
  "transliteration": "sīdanti mama gātrāṇi mukhaṁ ca pariśuṣyati |\nvepathuś ca śarīre me romaharṣaś ca jāyate ||",
  "translation": "My limbs are giving way, my mouth is drying up, my body trembles, and my hair stands on end.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna describes the physical symptoms of his mental and emotional distress as he stands on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He experiences a complete psychosomatic breakdown: his limbs are weakening and unable to support him, his mouth becomes parched, his entire body shakes uncontrollably, and his hair stands on end (horripilation). These are classic symptoms of extreme anxiety, fear, and moral confusion that have overtaken the great warrior.\n\nThis verse is significant because it shows how even the mightiest of warriors can be overwhelmed when faced with a profound moral dilemma. Arjuna's physical collapse mirrors his psychological and spiritual crisis. The symptoms he describes are not those of a coward, but of a sensitive soul who suddenly perceives the full horror of fratricide and the destruction of his own family and teachers. His body is rebelling against the prospect of this war, manifesting the deep inner conflict between his duty as a warrior (kshatriya dharma) and his natural compassion and familial bonds.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for Krishna's teachings in the subsequent chapters. Arjuna's complete breakdown—physical, mental, and spiritual—creates the perfect condition for receiving higher knowledge. His vulnerability and honest expression of his condition demonstrate the humility necessary for a true disciple. The Gita's wisdom emerges precisely from this moment of crisis, showing that spiritual awakening often comes through confronting our deepest fears and contradictions.",
