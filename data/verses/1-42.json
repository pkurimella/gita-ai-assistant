  "sanskrit": "सङ्करो नरकायैव कुलघ्नानां कुलस्य च ।\nपतन्ति पितरो ह्येषां लुप्तपिण्डोदकक्रियाः ॥",
  "transliteration": "saṅkaro narakāyaiva kulaghnānāṁ kulasya ca |\npatanti pitaro hyeṣāṁ luptapiṇḍodakakriyāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Such intermixing of castes leads to hell for both the destroyers of the family and the family itself. Their ancestors fall, being deprived of the offerings of rice-balls and water.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to express his concerns about the consequences of war, focusing on the spiritual and social ramifications. He argues that when family traditions are destroyed and intermixing of varnas (social orders) occurs, it leads to the downfall of not only the living but also the departed ancestors. According to Vedic tradition, descendants have a sacred duty to perform śrāddha ceremonies, offering piṇḍa (rice-balls) and water to their ancestors to ensure their well-being in the afterlife.\n\nArjuna's argument reflects the deep-rooted belief in the importance of maintaining family lineage and dharmic duties across generations. He fears that the destruction of family elders in battle will result in the breakdown of these sacred traditions, as there will be no one left to properly perform the ancestral rites. This concern demonstrates Arjuna's understanding of the interconnected nature of duties—not just to the living, but also to past and future generations. His reasoning, though appearing compassionate and dutiful, is based on a limited understanding that Krishna will later address, showing how attachment to social conventions can sometimes obscure one's true dharma.",
