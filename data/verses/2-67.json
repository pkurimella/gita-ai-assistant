  "translation": "For the mind that follows in the wake of the wandering senses carries away one's discrimination, just as a wind carries away a boat on the waters.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides a powerful metaphor to illustrate how the uncontrolled senses can completely destabilize one's spiritual understanding and wisdom. Just as a strong wind can blow a boat off course on water, rendering the helmsman helpless, similarly when the mind becomes attached to even one of the roaming senses, it loses all discrimination and wisdom. The verse emphasizes the vulnerability of the human mind when it submits to sensory impulses rather than maintaining mastery over them.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Sāṅkhya Yoga philosophy presented in Chapter 2, where Krishna systematically explains the need for sense control and mental discipline. The verse follows the previous discussion on how contemplation of sense objects leads to attachment, desire, anger, and ultimately destruction of wisdom. Here, Krishna specifically warns that even if one has developed discrimination (prajñā), it can be instantly swept away if the mind follows the senses, just as a boat is helplessly carried by wind regardless of its previous stability.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that spiritual progress is not merely about acquiring knowledge, but about maintaining constant vigilance over the senses and mind. This verse serves as a warning that even advanced practitioners can fall if they allow their mind to be controlled by sensory attractions. It underscores the importance of the practice of pratyāhāra (sense withdrawal) and the cultivation of vairāgya (dispassion) as essential components of the yogic path toward self-realization.",
