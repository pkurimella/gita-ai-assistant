  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses Arjuna's fundamental delusion—the belief that he has the freedom to choose not to fight based on his egoistic reasoning. Krishna warns that Arjuna's resolution to abstain from battle, born from false identification with the ego (ahaṅkāra), is ultimately futile. The Lord explains that one's inherent nature (prakṛti), shaped by one's svabhāva and accumulated karmic tendencies (saṁskāras), will inevitably compel action according to one's innate disposition.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18's teaching on the interplay between free will and determinism. Krishna is revealing that what Arjuna perceives as a free choice is actually a delusion created by ego. As a Kshatriya warrior, Arjuna's very nature is oriented toward battle and the protection of dharma. His attempt to renounce this duty is not true renunciation but rather an escape motivated by attachment and confusion. The verse emphasizes that one cannot escape one's svadharma (inherent duty) through mere mental resolve; instead, one must align conscious choice with one's true nature and perform actions in accordance with dharma, without egoistic attachment to outcomes.",
