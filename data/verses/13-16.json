  "transliteration": "bahir antaś ca bhūtānām acaraṁ caram eva ca |\nsūkṣmatvāt tad avijñeyaṁ dūrasthaṁ cāntike ca tat ||",
  "translation": "That (Supreme Reality) exists outside and inside all beings, both the moving and the unmoving. Because of Its subtlety, It is incomprehensible. It is far away, yet It is near.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the paradoxical nature of Brahman, the Supreme Reality. He explains that this ultimate truth pervades all existence—it is both external and internal to all creatures, encompassing both animate (moving) and inanimate (unmoving) beings. This indicates the all-pervasive nature of consciousness that transcends the dualities of inside-outside and living-nonliving.\n\nThe verse highlights an apparent contradiction that characterizes the nature of Brahman: it is simultaneously incomprehensible due to its extreme subtlety, yet it is the most intimate reality of our existence. It appears distant because it cannot be grasped by the ordinary senses or intellect, which are too gross to perceive such refined reality. However, it is also the nearest thing to us, being the very essence of our own Self. This paradox points to the limitation of conceptual understanding and the need for direct realization through spiritual practice and wisdom. The verse emphasizes that Brahman cannot be known through ordinary means of perception, yet it is not separate from anything—it is the substratum of all existence, closer to us than our own breath.",
