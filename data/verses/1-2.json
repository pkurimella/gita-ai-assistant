  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\ndṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṃ vyūḍhaṃ duryodhanas tadā\nācāryam upasaṅgamya rājā vacanam abravīt",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: At that time, having seen the army of the Pandavas arranged in military formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke these words.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Sanjaya's narration to the blind King Dhritarashtra about the events unfolding on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Duryodhana, upon observing the well-organized Pandava army, immediately approaches his military teacher Dronacharya. This action reveals Duryodhana's psychological state—despite being the aggressor in this war, he feels a sense of anxiety upon seeing the enemy forces properly arrayed for battle.\n\nThe verse sets in motion the dramatic dialogue that characterizes the first chapter. Duryodhana's approach to Drona is significant because it shows his need for reassurance and his attempt to bolster his own confidence by reviewing his forces. The word 'rājā' (king) is used here, emphasizing Duryodhana's royal position, though his legitimacy to that title is questionable given the circumstances that led to this war. This verse establishes the tension and uncertainty that pervades the battlefield, foreshadowing the deeper crisis of conscience that will soon afflict Arjuna.",
