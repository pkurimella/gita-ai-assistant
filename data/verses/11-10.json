  "transliteration": "aneka-vaktra-nayanam anekādbhuta-darśanam |\naneka-divyābharaṇaṁ divyānekodyatāyudham ||",
  "translation": "With countless mouths and eyes, with countless wondrous sights, with countless divine ornaments, and countless divine weapons upraised.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Sanjaya's description of the cosmic form (Vishvarupa) that Krishna has revealed to Arjuna. The repetition of 'aneka' (countless/many) emphasizes the infinite and incomprehensible nature of the divine vision. The universal form possesses innumerable mouths and eyes, suggesting omniscience and omnipresence - the ability to see all, speak all, and be present everywhere simultaneously.\n\nThe description of countless wondrous sights, divine ornaments, and upraised weapons indicates that this form encompasses all aspects of existence - the beautiful and the terrible, the creative and the destructive. The divine ornaments (divyābharaṇa) represent the glory and majesty of the Supreme, while the upraised weapons (udyatāyudha) symbolize the Lord's role as the protector of dharma and the destroyer of evil. This vision transcends ordinary human perception and reveals the totality of cosmic manifestation.\n\nThis verse is part of the initial description of the Vishvarupa, preparing both Arjuna and the reader for the overwhelming nature of the divine revelation. It establishes that the Supreme Reality cannot be confined to any single form or limited conception, but rather encompasses infinite manifestations simultaneously. This multiplicity within unity is a key teaching of Vedantic philosophy, showing how the one Brahman appears as the many phenomena of the universe.",
