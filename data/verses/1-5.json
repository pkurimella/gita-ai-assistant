  "transliteration": "dhṛṣṭaketuś cekitānaḥ kāśirājaś ca vīryavān |\npurujit kuntibhojaś ca śaibyaś ca nara-puṅgavaḥ ||5||",
  "translation": "Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya—that best of men.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Sanjaya continues his enumeration of the great warriors assembled on the Pandava side. He names six prominent warriors: Dhrishtaketu (the king of Chedi and son of Shishupala), Chekitana (a Yadava warrior and friend of the Pandavas), the King of Kashi (Varanasi) who is specifically described as 'vīryavān' (mighty or valiant), Purujit (a king and ally), Kuntibhoja (the foster-father of Kunti, mother of the Pandavas), and Shaibya (King of Shibi), who is honored with the title 'nara-puṅgava' (best among men or bull among men).\n\nThis systematic listing serves multiple purposes in the narrative structure of the Gita. Dhritarashtra, being blind, depends entirely on Sanjaya's description to understand the battlefield situation. The detailed enumeration emphasizes the formidable strength of the Pandava army, which includes not only the Pandava brothers themselves but also numerous allied kings and warriors of great repute. The use of honorific epithets like 'vīryavān' and 'nara-puṅgava' underscores the quality and caliber of warriors supporting the righteous cause of the Pandavas. This verse, along with the surrounding verses, sets the stage for the moral and spiritual crisis that Arjuna will soon experience when he contemplates fighting against his own relatives and revered teachers on the opposing side.",
