  "translation": "Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that deity and from that worship he obtains his desires, which are indeed granted by Me alone.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a profound truth about the worship of various deities. When a devotee, filled with faith (śraddhā) that Krishna Himself has ordained in their heart, worships a particular deity, they do receive the fruits of their worship. However, Krishna makes it clear that He is the ultimate grantor of all boons, regardless of which deity is being worshiped. The various deities act as intermediaries, but the actual fulfillment comes from the Supreme Lord alone.\n\nThis teaching addresses the common practice of worshiping different deities for specific material desires. Krishna does not condemn this practice but reveals its inner mechanism - all worship ultimately reaches Him, and all benedictions flow from Him through the various deities. This verse demonstrates Krishna's position as the Supreme Controller and the source of all divine powers. It also shows His compassion in allowing people to approach the Divine through various forms according to their faith and understanding, while gently guiding them toward the ultimate truth that He is the source of all.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that while people may worship different forms with sincere faith, the cosmic order is maintained by the one Supreme Reality. This understanding helps reconcile the apparent multiplicity of divine worship with the underlying unity of the Divine, a central theme in Hindu philosophy. It also prepares the ground for the next verse, which will discuss the temporary nature of such material gains compared to devotion to the Supreme.",
