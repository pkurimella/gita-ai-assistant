  "translation": "For such a person, there is no purpose to be gained by action performed, nor any loss by action not performed; nor does such a person depend on any being for any purpose.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of a self-realized person who has transcended all worldly dependencies and motivations. Krishna explains that one who has attained self-knowledge has nothing to gain from performing actions nor anything to lose from not performing them. Such a person acts without personal desire or attachment to results, having realized the completeness of the Self. This does not mean inaction, but rather action performed without selfish motivation.\n\nThe verse emphasizes complete independence (svatantra) from external circumstances and beings. The self-realized person does not depend on anyone for fulfillment because they have found completeness within. This state represents the highest freedom where actions continue naturally without creating bondage. In the context of Chapter 3, this verse establishes the ideal state that karma yoga leads to—a state where one performs duties without any sense of personal gain or loss, acting purely for the welfare of the world (lokasaṅgraha) as mentioned in subsequent verses.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant to Arjuna's situation, showing him that the truly wise person acts from a place of inner fulfillment rather than need. Such action is spontaneous, selfless, and free from the anxiety of results. It represents the culmination of karma yoga practice where duty is performed perfectly because it is no longer contaminated by personal desire or fear of consequences.",
