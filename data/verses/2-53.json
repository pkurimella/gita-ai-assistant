  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the culminating state of spiritual practice to Arjuna. The phrase 'śruti-vipratipannā' refers to the confusion that arises from hearing various interpretations of scriptural texts and conflicting philosophical doctrines. Krishna assures Arjuna that when his intellect (buddhi) transcends this confusion and becomes firmly established in samādhi (meditative absorption), he will achieve yoga—union with the Supreme Self.\n\nThis verse is significant within Chapter 2 as it marks a transition point where Krishna moves from theoretical knowledge to the practical attainment of Self-realization. The 'niścalā buddhi' (unwavering intellect) represents a state beyond mere intellectual understanding, where direct experiential knowledge dawns. This steadiness is not rigidity but rather a profound stability that comes from inner realization, unshaken by external opinions or scriptural debates.\n\nThe philosophical importance of this verse lies in its emphasis on direct experience over bookish knowledge. While scriptures are valuable guides, ultimate realization comes when the intellect becomes one-pointed and steady in meditation. This state of 'acalā buddhi' in samādhi represents the practical goal of yoga—a state of consciousness where the individual self recognizes its identity with the Supreme Self, transcending all dualities and mental fluctuations.",
