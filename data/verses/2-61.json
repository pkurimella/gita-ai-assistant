  "transliteration": "tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ |\nvaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā ||",
  "translation": "Having restrained all the senses, one should remain steadfast in yoga, absorbed in Me as the Supreme Goal. For one whose senses are under control, steady wisdom is firmly established.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides the practical method for achieving the state of sthita-prajña (steady wisdom) described in the previous verses. He emphasizes that mere intellectual understanding is insufficient; one must actively practice sense control (saṁyama) and remain absorbed in devotion to the Supreme. The phrase 'mat-paraḥ' (absorbed in Me) indicates that sense control is not merely suppression but redirection of consciousness toward the Divine, which is the highest form of yoga.\n\nThe verse establishes a clear causal relationship: when the senses are brought under control (vaśe), steady wisdom (prajñā pratiṣṭhitā) naturally follows. This is not a state of dry asceticism but one of positive engagement where the mind, freed from sensory distractions, can rest in its true nature. Krishna positions Himself as both the means and the goal—the practice involves devotion to Him, and the result is union with Him.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's practical philosophy. It bridges the gap between knowledge (jñāna) and devotion (bhakti), showing that true wisdom requires both disciplined practice and loving surrender. The verse also addresses Arjuna's immediate situation: rather than being controlled by his emotions and sensory perceptions of the battlefield, he must establish himself in higher consciousness through self-control and devotion to Krishna as his guide and goal.",
