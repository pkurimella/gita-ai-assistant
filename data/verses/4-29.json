  "sanskrit": "अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणेऽपानं तथापरे ।\nप्राणापानगती रुद्ध्वा प्राणायामपरायणाः ॥",
  "transliteration": "apāne juhvati prāṇaṁ prāṇe'pānaṁ tathāpare |\nprāṇāpāna-gatī ruddhvā prāṇāyāma-parāyaṇāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Others offer the outgoing breath (prāṇa) into the incoming breath (apāna), and the incoming breath into the outgoing breath, restraining the movement of both prāṇa and apāna, wholly absorbed in the practice of breath control (prāṇāyāma).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes another form of yogic sacrifice—the practice of prāṇāyāma or breath control. Krishna explains how some yogis perform sacrifice through the regulation of vital energies. By offering prāṇa (the outward-moving breath) into apāna (the inward-moving breath) and vice versa, they create a state of equilibrium and stillness within the body's energy system. This practice involves stopping the natural flow of breath at specific points, creating a state of suspended animation that leads to deeper states of meditation and consciousness.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that these practitioners are 'prāṇāyāma-parāyaṇāḥ'—completely devoted to the science of breath control. This is not casual breathing exercise but a dedicated spiritual practice aimed at controlling the life force itself. In the context of Chapter 4's discussion of various forms of sacrifice (yajña), this represents the internalization of ritual—instead of external offerings, the yogi offers one vital force into another within their own being. This practice purifies the subtle body, calms the mind, and prepares the practitioner for higher states of awareness.\n\nThis verse fits within the broader theme of the chapter, which presents knowledge (jñāna) as the ultimate purifier and describes various paths through which seekers can attain self-realization. The practice of prāṇāyāma represents the intersection of physical discipline and spiritual aspiration, demonstrating that the body itself can become an altar for sacrifice when properly understood and utilized.",
