  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna establishes the eternal nature of the soul (ātman), directly addressing Arjuna's grief over the impending death of his kinsmen. Krishna declares that the soul is eternal—it has always existed, exists now, and will continue to exist forever. This is not merely a philosophical abstraction but a fundamental truth about the nature of consciousness and individual existence. By stating 'I,' 'you,' and 'all these kings,' Krishna emphasizes that individual identity persists through time, though the body may change.\n\nThis verse serves as the foundation for Krishna's teaching on the immortality of the soul, which forms the core of his response to Arjuna's despondency. The statement directly counters the materialistic view that consciousness arises from and ends with the body. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that what he grieves for—the death of his relatives—is impossible, because the true self cannot die. This teaching is central to Sāṅkhya philosophy, which distinguishes between the eternal, unchanging self (puruṣa) and the temporary, changing material nature (prakṛti).\n\nThe verse also establishes Krishna's authority as a teacher who speaks from the perspective of eternal truth. By including himself in this declaration of eternality, Krishna subtly hints at his divine nature, which will be more fully revealed later in the Gita. This verse marks a pivotal shift from Arjuna's emotional crisis to the philosophical discourse that will provide the solution to his dilemma.",
