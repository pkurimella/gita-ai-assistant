  "transliteration": "daṇḍo damayatām asmi nītir asmi jigīṣatām |\nmaunaṁ caivāsmi guhyānāṁ jñānaṁ jñānavatām aham ||38||",
  "translation": "I am the rod of discipline among those who restrain; I am the statesmanship of those who seek victory; I am the silence among secrets; and I am the knowledge of the knowers.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate His divine manifestations across various domains of excellence. He declares Himself to be the daṇḍa (rod or staff of punishment) among those who enforce discipline, representing righteous authority and just punishment that maintains dharma. Among those seeking victory (jigīṣatām), He is nīti—the wise policy, ethical strategy, and righteous statesmanship that leads to legitimate success without compromising moral principles.\n\nKrishna then identifies Himself with mauna (silence) among guhya (secrets or mysteries). This profound statement suggests that the highest secret or mystery is best preserved through silence, and that silence itself is the supreme form of maintaining confidentiality. Finally, He declares that among the knowledgeable (jñānavatām), He is jñāna itself—the knowledge or wisdom they possess. This indicates that all true knowledge ultimately emanates from the Divine and returns to it. The verse emphasizes that whether in governance, discipline, discretion, or wisdom, the supreme principle underlying all excellence is the Divine presence itself, manifesting as the highest expression in each category.",
