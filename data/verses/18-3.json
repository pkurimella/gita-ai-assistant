  "translation": "Some wise men declare that all action should be abandoned as evil, while others say that acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be renounced.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents two contrasting philosophical viewpoints regarding the renunciation of action (karma-sannyasa). The first school of thought, held by certain philosophers, maintains that all action is inherently flawed and should be completely abandoned because action inevitably leads to bondage through attachment and desire. They view karma itself as doṣavat (faulty or defective) and advocate complete withdrawal from all activities.\n\nThe second perspective, held by other wise teachers, makes an important distinction between different types of actions. They argue that while selfish, desire-driven actions should be renounced, certain sacred activities—specifically yajña (sacrifice or worship), dāna (charity), and tapas (austerity)—should never be abandoned as these purify the mind and lead to spiritual progress. This sets up Krishna's synthesis in the following verses, where he will clarify which interpretation is correct and how true renunciation should be understood. This verse is crucial as it establishes the framework for understanding the distinction between tyāga (renunciation of fruits) and sannyāsa (renunciation of action itself), which forms the philosophical core of this final chapter.",
