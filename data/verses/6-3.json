  "translation": "For a sage who wishes to ascend to yoga, action is said to be the means; for one who has already attained yoga, tranquility (cessation of action) is said to be the means.",
  "commentary": "This verse outlines the two distinct stages in the spiritual journey of a practitioner. Krishna explains that karma (action) serves as the stepping stone for those who are beginning their ascent toward yoga. For the aspirant (ārurukṣu), selfless action performed without attachment helps purify the mind and develop the necessary discipline and concentration required for meditation. This is the preparatory phase where one must actively engage in righteous duties while cultivating detachment.\n\nOnce a practitioner has established themselves in yoga (yogārūḍha), having achieved a certain level of inner stability and self-mastery, the emphasis shifts from external action to inner tranquility (śama). At this advanced stage, the focus becomes maintaining equanimity and deepening meditation rather than performing external actions. This does not mean complete abandonment of all activity, but rather that the primary means of progress becomes inner stillness and contemplation. This verse thus reconciles the apparent contradiction between the paths of action (karma yoga) and meditation (dhyana yoga), showing them as sequential stages rather than opposing methods, each appropriate to the practitioner's level of spiritual development.",
