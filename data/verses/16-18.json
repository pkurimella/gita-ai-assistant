  "transliteration": "ahaṅkāraṁ balaṁ darpaṁ kāmaṁ krodhaṁ ca saṁśritāḥ |\nmām ātma-para-deheṣu pradviṣanto 'bhyasūyakāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Possessed by egoism, power, arrogance, lust, and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and in the bodies of others.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the psychological and spiritual state of those with demoniac qualities. Krishna identifies six primary characteristics that dominate such individuals: ahaṅkāra (egoism), bala (brute force or power), darpa (arrogance or pride), kāma (lust or selfish desire), krodha (anger), and abhyasūyā (malice or envy). These qualities form an interconnected web that traps the individual in ignorance and suffering. The verse emphasizes that those possessed by these qualities not only harm themselves but also harbor hatred toward the Divine presence within all beings.\n\nThe profound insight here is that such individuals hate the Divine (Krishna) both in their own bodies and in others' bodies. This refers to the fundamental teaching that the Supreme resides as the inner Self (Ātman) in all beings. By acting with egoism, violence, and hatred, demoniac people effectively reject and oppose the divine presence within themselves and others. They fail to recognize the sacred nature of all life and instead treat themselves and others as mere objects for exploitation and domination.\n\nThis verse serves as a warning about the destructive path of those who cultivate negative qualities. It shows how these traits reinforce each other—egoism leads to arrogance, which combined with desire and anger, results in malicious behavior toward all. The reference to hating God in one's own body is particularly significant, as it suggests that such individuals are fundamentally at war with their own true nature, leading to inner conflict and eventual self-destruction. This sets up the following verses which describe the karmic consequences of such behavior.",
