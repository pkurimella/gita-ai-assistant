  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Keshava, what are the characteristics of one who is situated in transcendental consciousness and steady in wisdom? How does such a person of steady mind speak, how does he sit, and how does he walk?",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a pivotal transition in the Bhagavad Gita, as Arjuna asks Krishna to describe the practical characteristics of a sthita-prajña—one established in transcendental wisdom. Having heard Krishna's profound teachings on the immortality of the soul and the nature of the Self, Arjuna now seeks to understand how such wisdom manifests in daily life. He asks three specific questions about speech, sitting (or being), and movement, representing the totality of human behavior and expression.\n\nThis inquiry is significant because it shifts the discourse from abstract philosophy to practical spirituality. Arjuna wants to know not just the theory of Self-realization, but its observable signs and symptoms. The term sthita-prajña refers to one whose wisdom (prajña) is firmly established (sthita), while samādhi-stha indicates one absorbed in divine consciousness. These questions reveal Arjuna's sincere desire to recognize and perhaps emulate such elevated souls.\n\nKrishna's response to this question, spanning the next eighteen verses (2.55-72), provides one of the most celebrated descriptions of the ideal sage in Hindu philosophy. This section, known as the Sthita-prajña-lakṣaṇa (characteristics of the steady-minded), becomes a practical guide for spiritual aspirants, describing how enlightened wisdom translates into everyday conduct, emotional stability, and interaction with the world.",
