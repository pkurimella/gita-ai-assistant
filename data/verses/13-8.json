  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's enumeration of the qualities that constitute true knowledge (jñāna). These virtues are not merely ethical guidelines but essential prerequisites for spiritual realization. The verse presents seven fundamental qualities: humility (amānitvam) means freedom from pride and the desire for honor; unpretentiousness (adambhitvam) is absence of hypocrisy and false display; non-violence (ahiṃsā) extends beyond physical harm to include mental and verbal injury; forgiveness (kṣānti) is patient endurance and tolerance; uprightness (ārjavam) means straightforwardness in thought, word, and deed; service to the teacher (ācāryopāsana) involves reverent attendance and learning from a qualified spiritual guide; purity (śaucam) encompasses both external cleanliness and internal mental purity; steadfastness (sthairyam) is firmness of purpose; and self-control (ātma-vinigraha) is mastery over the senses and mind.\n\nThese qualities form the foundation for discriminative knowledge between the Field (kṣetra) and the Knower of the Field (kṣetrajña), which is the central theme of this chapter. Krishna emphasizes that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient; one must cultivate these virtues to purify the mind and make it receptive to higher wisdom. This verse, along with the following verses up to verse 12, collectively describe what Krishna calls 'jñāna' (knowledge), though they are actually the means to knowledge rather than knowledge itself. The cultivation of these qualities prepares the seeker for the direct realization of the Self, transforming theoretical understanding into lived experience.",
