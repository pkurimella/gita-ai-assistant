  "transliteration": "antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām |\ndevān deva-yajo yānti mad-bhaktā yānti mām api ||23||",
  "translation": "But the fruits gained by those of limited understanding are temporary. The worshippers of the celestial gods go to the gods, while My devotees come to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a crucial distinction between the temporary rewards obtained through worship of celestial deities and the eternal liberation attained through devotion to the Supreme. Those of 'alpa-medhas' (limited intelligence or understanding) seek material benefits through worship of various deities, and while they may achieve their desired results, these fruits are 'antavat' (perishable and temporary). Such worshippers attain the realms of the deities they worship, which, though celestial, are still within the realm of material existence and subject to time and dissolution.\n\nKrishna contrasts this with the path of His true devotees who worship the Supreme Reality directly. These devotees transcend the cycle of birth and death and attain His eternal, imperishable abode. This verse emphasizes the principle that the destination one reaches corresponds to the object of one's worship and devotion. The philosophical implication is profound: worship of the finite yields finite results, while worship of the Infinite yields infinite, eternal results. This teaching encourages seekers to look beyond temporary material gains and direct their devotion toward the ultimate Reality, thereby achieving permanent liberation rather than temporary heavenly pleasures that eventually exhaust themselves.",
