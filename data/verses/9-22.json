  "transliteration": "ananyāś cintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate |\nteṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yogakṣemaṁ vahāmy aham ||22||",
  "translation": "To those who worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on Me constantly, to those ever-steadfast devotees, I personally bring what they lack (yoga) and preserve what they already have (kshema).",
  "commentary": "This verse reveals one of the most compassionate promises in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna assures that those who worship Him with ananya-bhakti (exclusive, undivided devotion) and remain constantly absorbed in thoughts of the Divine need not worry about their material or spiritual welfare. The term 'ananya' is crucial here—it means 'not other,' indicating devotees who see nothing as separate from Krishna and have no other refuge or goal. These devotees are described as 'nityābhiyuktānām'—those who are perpetually engaged in devotion.\n\nThe concept of 'yoga-kshema' is significant and comprehensive. 'Yoga' refers to the acquisition of what one does not yet possess—both material necessities and spiritual attainments. 'Kshema' means the preservation and security of what one already has. Krishna's promise to personally carry (vahāmi) the burden of both acquisition and preservation for His devotees demonstrates the reciprocal nature of bhakti. When devotees surrender completely and focus their consciousness entirely on the Divine, the Divine takes complete responsibility for their welfare. This verse establishes the foundation of sharanagati (complete surrender) and illustrates how single-pointed devotion liberates one from worldly anxieties, allowing the devotee to remain absorbed in spiritual practice while divine grace manages all necessities.",
