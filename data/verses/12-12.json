  "sanskrit": "श्रेयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाद्ध्यानं विशिष्यते।\nध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्॥",
  "transliteration": "śreyo hi jñānam abhyāsāj jñānād dhyānaṁ viśiṣyate |\ndhyānāt karma-phala-tyāgas tyāgāc chāntir anantaram ||",
  "translation": "Knowledge is indeed better than mere practice; meditation is superior to knowledge; renunciation of the fruits of action is better than meditation; from such renunciation, peace immediately follows.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a hierarchy of spiritual practices for those who find the higher paths challenging. He presents a graduated approach to spiritual development. Abhyāsa (mechanical practice) is the starting point, but jñāna (knowledge or understanding of the principles) is superior because practice with understanding is more effective. Higher still is dhyāna (meditation), which represents the internalization and direct experience of that knowledge. However, the most accessible and immediately effective practice is karma-phala-tyāga—the renunciation of the fruits of one's actions.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 12, where Arjuna has asked about the relative superiority of different paths to the Divine. Krishna, ever compassionate, provides alternatives for aspirants at different levels of spiritual maturity. The emphasis on karma-phala-tyāga is crucial because it is something that can be practiced immediately in daily life without requiring years of preparation. By performing one's duties without attachment to results, dedicating all actions to the Divine, one can attain śānti (peace) directly. This peace is not merely psychological comfort but the tranquility that comes from freedom from the binding effects of karma, ultimately leading to liberation.",
