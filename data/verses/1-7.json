  "transliteration": "asmākaṁ tu viśiṣṭā ye tān nibodha dvijottama |\nnāyakā mama sainyasya saṁjñārthaṁ tān bravīmi te ||7||",
  "translation": "But for your information, O best of the twice-born, let me tell you about the distinguished commanders of my army, the principal warriors who are leading my forces.",
  "commentary": "Having enumerated the great warriors on the Pandava side, Duryodhana now turns to describe the commanders of his own Kaurava army. He addresses Dronacharya respectfully as 'dvijottama' (best of the twice-born), acknowledging his teacher's brahmin status. This verse marks a transition in Duryodhana's speech from analyzing the enemy's strength to reassuring himself and his teacher about his own military capabilities.\n\nDuryodhana's purpose in listing his own commanders is twofold: first, to demonstrate that despite the formidable array on the Pandava side, the Kauravas possess equally distinguished warriors; and second, to subtly remind Drona of his duty to fight for the side that has employed him. The phrase 'saṁjñārtham' (for the purpose of information) suggests a formal military briefing, though the underlying anxiety of the speaker is evident in his need to enumerate and validate his own forces.\n\nThis verse is significant in establishing the dramatic tension of the chapter. Duryodhana's careful cataloging of warriors on both sides reveals his inner uncertainty despite his outward show of confidence. It sets the stage for the subsequent verses where he will name his champions, ultimately leading to the blowing of conches and the beginning of the great battle that forms the backdrop for Krishna's teachings to Arjuna.",
