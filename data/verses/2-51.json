  "transliteration": "karma-jaṁ buddhi-yuktā hi phalaṁ tyaktvā manīṣiṇaḥ |\njanma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ padaṁ gacchanty anāmayam ||",
  "translation": "The wise, possessed of equanimous intellect, renouncing the fruits born of action, freed from the bondage of birth, attain the state beyond all suffering.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the ultimate liberation attained by those who practice buddhi-yoga (the yoga of discriminative wisdom). The wise ones (manīṣiṇaḥ) who have established themselves in equanimous intellect (buddhi-yuktā) and who renounce the fruits of their actions (karma-phala-tyāga) transcend the cycle of birth and death. This is the practical culmination of the teaching on karma-yoga that Krishna has been expounding.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that liberation is not merely theoretical but a concrete state of freedom from janma-bandha (the bondage of repeated birth). By performing actions without attachment to results, the wise person exhausts past karmas and creates no new binding karmas. This leads to the attainment of 'padam anāmayam' - the state beyond all suffering, disease, and affliction, which refers to moksha or final liberation.\n\nThis teaching is central to Chapter 2's theme of transcending sorrow through wisdom and detached action. Krishna is showing Arjuna that the path of selfless action, performed with equanimity and without desire for fruits, leads not just to temporary peace but to ultimate liberation from the cycle of samsara itself. This verse bridges the philosophical understanding of the Self with the practical application of karma-yoga.",
