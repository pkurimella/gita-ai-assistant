  "sanskrit": "प्रयत्नाद्यतमानस्तु योगी संशुद्धकिल्बिषः।\nअनेकजन्मसंसिद्धस्ततो याति परां गतिम्॥",
  "transliteration": "prayatnād yatamānas tu yogī saṁśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ|\naneka-janma-saṁsiddhas tato yāti parāṁ gatim||",
  "translation": "But the yogi who strives with sincere effort, purified of all sins, perfected through many births, then attains the supreme goal.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the culmination of the spiritual journey for the yogi who fell from the path but resumed practice. Krishna assures that through diligent effort (prayatna) and sincere striving, such a yogi becomes purified of all impurities and karmic residues (saṁśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ). The phrase 'aneka-janma-saṁsiddhaḥ' indicates that perfection is achieved through the accumulated spiritual merit and practice of many lifetimes, not just the current one.\n\nThis verse provides great encouragement to spiritual aspirants by emphasizing that no effort in yoga is ever wasted. The progressive purification and perfection that occurs over multiple births ensures that the sincere seeker will eventually reach the supreme goal (parāṁ gatim), which is liberation or union with the Divine. This teaching removes the anxiety that one might fail in spiritual practice, as Krishna guarantees that persistent effort across lifetimes leads to ultimate success. The verse thus connects with the earlier assurance that the failed yogi takes birth in favorable circumstances to continue the spiritual journey, and now confirms that such continuation inevitably leads to the highest attainment.",
