  "sanskrit": "न हि देहभृता शक्यं त्यक्तुं कर्माण्यशेषतः।\nयस्तु कर्मफलत्यागी स त्यागीत्यभिधीयते॥",
  "transliteration": "na hi deha-bhṛtā śakyaṁ tyaktuṁ karmāṇy aśeṣataḥ |\nyas tu karma-phala-tyāgī sa tyāgīty abhidhīyate ||",
  "translation": "It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to completely abandon all actions. But one who renounces the fruits of action is truly called a renunciant.",
  "commentary": "In this pivotal verse, Krishna clarifies the practical definition of true renunciation (tyāga). He acknowledges the fundamental reality that as long as one possesses a physical body, complete cessation of all action is impossible. Even basic bodily functions like breathing, circulation, and metabolism constitute actions. Therefore, the ideal of absolute inaction is neither achievable nor desirable for embodied beings.\n\nKrishna then provides the solution: true renunciation lies not in abandoning action itself, but in relinquishing attachment to the fruits or results of action (karma-phala-tyāga). This teaching reconciles the apparent contradiction between the path of action (karma yoga) and renunciation (sannyāsa). One can remain fully engaged in worldly duties while maintaining inner detachment from outcomes, expectations, and personal gains. This verse establishes the foundation for understanding that renunciation is primarily an internal attitude rather than an external withdrawal from activity.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's practical philosophy, making spiritual life accessible to all, not just those who can physically withdraw from society. It emphasizes that liberation can be achieved through transformed action rather than through the abandonment of action, which is the essence of karma yoga that Krishna has been teaching throughout the Gita.",
