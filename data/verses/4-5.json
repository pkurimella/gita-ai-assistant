  "translation": "Many births of Mine have passed, and many of yours too, O Arjuna. I know them all, but you do not know them, O scorcher of foes.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna responds to Arjuna's implicit doubt about how Krishna could have taught this ancient yoga to Vivasvān (the sun-god) in the distant past. Krishna reveals the fundamental difference between divine incarnation and ordinary human birth. While both Krishna and Arjuna have taken numerous births, Krishna possesses complete knowledge of all His previous incarnations, whereas Arjuna, like all ordinary beings, is subject to the veil of ignorance that obscures memory of past lives.\n\nThis verse establishes a crucial philosophical distinction in Hindu thought between the Avatar (divine incarnation) and the ordinary soul bound by karma. Krishna's omniscience regarding His past births demonstrates His divine nature and His freedom from the limitations of māyā (cosmic illusion) that bind ordinary souls. The Lord incarnates by His own free will (svecchā) while maintaining full consciousness, whereas ordinary beings are compelled to take birth due to their karmic impressions and desires, losing memory of their previous existences. This verse sets the foundation for understanding the doctrine of divine incarnation (avatāra-vāda) that Krishna will elaborate upon in the following verses.",
