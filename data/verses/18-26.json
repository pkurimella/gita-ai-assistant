  "translation": "The doer who is free from attachment, non-egoistic, endowed with determination and enthusiasm, and unaffected by success or failure—such a doer is said to be in the mode of goodness (sattva).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of a sattvic (pure, goodness-oriented) doer or agent of action. This verse is part of a larger section where Krishna analyzes the three gunas (modes of material nature) as they manifest in different aspects of action, including the agent, intellect, resolve, and happiness. The sattvic doer represents the ideal performer of action who has transcended personal motivations while remaining fully engaged in duty.\n\nThe sattvic agent is characterized by four primary qualities: freedom from attachment (mukta-saṅga), absence of ego or false identification (anahaṁ-vādi), possession of steadiness and enthusiasm (dhṛti-utsāha), and equanimity in success and failure (siddhy-asiddhyor nirvikāra). Such a person performs actions as an offering to the divine or as duty, without being bound by the fruits. They maintain enthusiasm and determination not from personal ambition but from alignment with dharma. This balanced state allows them to remain peaceful and centered regardless of outcomes, as their sense of self-worth is not dependent on results.\n\nThis description is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18's synthesis of karma yoga. Krishna is showing that renunciation does not mean abandoning action, but rather transforming one's relationship to action by purifying the consciousness of the doer. The sattvic doer embodies the principle of nishkama karma (desireless action) taught throughout the Gita, demonstrating how one can be fully engaged in the world while remaining spiritually free. This verse provides a practical benchmark for spiritual practitioners to assess and refine their own approach to action.",
