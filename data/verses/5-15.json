  "sanskrit": "नादत्ते कस्यचित्पापं न चैव सुकृतं विभुः।\nअज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानं तेन मुह्यन्ति जन्तवः॥",
  "transliteration": "nādatte kasyacit pāpaṁ na caiva sukṛtaṁ vibhuḥ |\najñānenāvṛtaṁ jñānaṁ tena muhyanti jantavaḥ ||",
  "translation": "The all-pervading Spirit does not take on the sin or merit of anyone. Knowledge is covered by ignorance; thereby beings are deluded.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna clarifies a fundamental principle of spiritual philosophy: the Supreme Self (Vibhu) neither accepts the sins nor the virtuous deeds of any being. The Absolute Reality remains untouched and unaffected by the karmic actions of individuals. This statement addresses a common misconception that God is responsible for human suffering or moral failings. The Supreme is eternally pure consciousness, beyond the dualities of good and evil.\n\nThe second half of the verse reveals the actual cause of human bondage and delusion. It is not divine will but ignorance (ajñāna) that covers the inherent knowledge (jñāna) within all beings, much like clouds obscure the sun. This ignorance causes beings to misidentify themselves with the body-mind complex and to attribute agency to the eternal Self, leading them to believe they are the doers of actions and experiencers of their fruits. This fundamental misunderstanding perpetuates the cycle of karma and rebirth.\n\nThis verse is central to the chapter's theme of karma-sannyāsa, as it establishes that liberation comes not from divine intervention but from removing the veil of ignorance through knowledge. When one realizes the true nature of the Self as distinct from actions and their results, one transcends the binding effects of karma. The verse thus emphasizes personal responsibility for spiritual evolution while affirming the transcendent purity of the Supreme Reality.",
