  "translation": "O son of Kunti, wisdom is covered by this eternal enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is insatiable like fire.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the fundamental obstacle to spiritual knowledge and self-realization. He describes desire (kāma) as the eternal enemy (nitya-vairin) that veils true wisdom (jñāna). The metaphor of fire is particularly significant—just as fire can never be satisfied no matter how much fuel is added to it, desire grows stronger with every attempt to satisfy it. This insatiable nature makes desire especially dangerous, as it perpetually obscures discriminative knowledge and keeps the soul bound to material existence.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Kaunteya' (son of Kunti), perhaps reminding him of his noble lineage and the higher wisdom he should aspire to. The verse emphasizes that desire is not just an occasional obstacle but a constant adversary that specifically targets those who seek knowledge. This teaching is central to the chapter's theme of karma yoga, as it explains why action performed with desire leads to bondage, while desireless action leads to liberation. The covering of wisdom by desire is compared to smoke covering fire or dust covering a mirror—the knowledge exists but cannot shine through until the covering is removed.",
