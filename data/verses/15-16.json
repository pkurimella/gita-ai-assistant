  "transliteration": "dvāv imau puruṣau loke kṣaraś cākṣara eva ca |\nkṣaraḥ sarvāṇi bhūtāni kūṭastho 'kṣara ucyate ||16||",
  "translation": "There are two types of beings in this world: the perishable (kṣara) and the imperishable (akṣara). All living beings constitute the perishable, while the unchanging one is called the imperishable.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna introduces a fundamental metaphysical distinction that forms the basis for understanding the concept of Puruṣottama (the Supreme Person) discussed in subsequent verses. He categorizes all existence into two types of puruṣas or beings: kṣara (the perishable, mutable) and akṣara (the imperishable, immutable). The kṣara refers to all manifested beings and the entire material creation subject to change, decay, and transformation. This includes all physical bodies and the ever-changing phenomenal world. The akṣara represents the unchanging substratum, often identified with the individual soul (jīvātman) in its pure, unconditioned state, or with Prakṛti in its unmanifest form.\n\nThis dualistic framework sets up the teaching that will culminate in verse 18, where Krishna reveals himself as Puruṣottama—the Supreme Person who transcends both the perishable and imperishable. The term 'kūṭastha' (standing at the peak, unchanging) emphasizes the immutable nature of the akṣara, which remains constant amidst all the flux of the material world. This classification helps the spiritual aspirant understand the different levels of reality and prepares them to comprehend the ultimate truth that transcends this duality. The verse is crucial for Vedantic philosophy as it establishes the ontological categories that lead to the understanding of the Absolute Reality beyond both manifestation and its unmanifest source.",
