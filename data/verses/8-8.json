  "transliteration": "abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā |\nparamaṁ puruṣaṁ divyaṁ yāti pārthānucintayan ||",
  "translation": "With a mind disciplined by the practice of yoga, which does not wander to anything else, one reaches the Supreme Divine Person, O Partha, by constantly meditating upon Him.",
  "commentary": "This verse emphasizes the importance of disciplined meditation and unwavering focus in attaining the Supreme Reality. Krishna instructs that through abhyāsa-yoga—the practice of constant and repeated meditation—one develops a mind that remains steadfast and does not wander toward other objects of desire or distraction. The phrase 'nānya-gāminā' (not going elsewhere) is crucial, indicating that the mind must be trained to remain fixed on the Divine alone, without deviation.\n\nThe verse connects directly to the preceding discussion about remembering the Divine at the time of death. Krishna explains that such remembrance at the final moment is only possible through consistent practice throughout one's life. The 'Paramaṁ Puruṣam' (Supreme Person) refers to the transcendental Divine Being who is beyond material nature, luminous and divine. This verse establishes the practical method—disciplined yoga practice—for achieving the goal described in earlier verses. It underscores that spiritual realization is not a matter of chance or last-minute effort, but the fruit of sustained, focused practice that trains the consciousness to remain absorbed in divine contemplation, ultimately leading to union with the Supreme at the time of death and beyond.",
