  "translation": "Devoted to one's own natural duty, a person attains perfection. Now hear from Me how one engaged in one's own work attains perfection.",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces the profound teaching that spiritual perfection can be achieved through dedicated performance of one's svadharma (own duty). Krishna emphasizes that every individual, by being devoted to their natural occupation according to their inherent nature (svabhāva), can attain the highest spiritual accomplishment. This is a democratic and inclusive vision of spirituality that does not require abandoning one's station in life or adopting external practices foreign to one's nature.\n\nThe verse serves as a transition, with Krishna promising to explain the method by which dedication to one's own work leads to perfection. This teaching is central to the Gita's practical philosophy of karma yoga. It resolves the apparent conflict between worldly duties and spiritual aspirations by showing that the path to liberation lies not in escaping one's responsibilities but in performing them with the right attitude and understanding. The repetition of 'svakarma' (one's own duty) emphasizes the importance of following one's authentic path rather than imitating others.\n\nIn the broader context of Chapter 18, this verse reinforces the teaching that renunciation does not mean abandoning action, but rather performing action without attachment to results. It prepares the ground for the subsequent verses that will elaborate on worshiping the Divine through one's work and the attitude of offering all actions to the Supreme.",
