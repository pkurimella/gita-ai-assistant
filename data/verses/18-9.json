  "sanskrit": "कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन।\nसङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः॥",
  "transliteration": "kāryam ity eva yat karma niyataṁ kriyate'rjuna |\nsaṅgaṁ tyaktvā phalaṁ caiva sa tyāgaḥ sāttviko mataḥ ||",
  "translation": "O Arjuna, when a prescribed duty is performed with the understanding that it must be done, abandoning attachment and desire for the fruit, that renunciation is considered to be in the mode of goodness (sattva).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna defines sattvic tyaga (renunciation in the mode of goodness), which represents the highest form of renunciation. This type of renunciation does not involve abandoning action itself, but rather abandoning attachment to the action and its results. The key phrase 'kāryam ity eva' (with the understanding 'it must be done') indicates that the action is performed out of a sense of duty and obligation, not personal desire or aversion. The performer recognizes the action as prescribed by dharma and necessary for the maintenance of cosmic and social order.\n\nThis verse is central to the Gita's teaching on karma yoga and resolves the apparent contradiction between action and renunciation. Krishna emphasizes that true renunciation (tyaga) is not physical abandonment of duties, but mental detachment from the fruits while continuing to perform one's prescribed duties. This sattvic renunciation is characterized by two essential elements: freedom from attachment (saṅga) to the action itself, and freedom from desire for results (phala). Such renunciation purifies the mind and leads to spiritual advancement while maintaining one's responsibilities in the world.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this teaching lies in its practical applicability to all individuals, regardless of their station in life. It provides a path to liberation that does not require physical withdrawal from society, but rather a transformation of consciousness while engaged in worldly duties. This sattvic tyaga represents the ideal balance between action and renunciation, making spiritual progress accessible to householders and active members of society, not just ascetics.",
