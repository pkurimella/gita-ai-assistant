  "transliteration": "yac cāpi sarva-bhūtānāṁ bījaṁ tad aham arjuna |\nna tad asti vinā yat syān mayā bhūtaṁ carācaram ||",
  "translation": "And whatever is the seed of all beings, that also am I, O Arjuna. There is no being, moving or unmoving, that can exist without Me.",
  "commentary": "In this concluding verse of Krishna's enumeration of His divine manifestations, He reveals the most fundamental truth: He is the very seed or source (bīja) of all existence. While the previous verses described specific manifestations in various categories, this verse establishes the universal principle that nothing whatsoever can exist independent of the Divine. Krishna is not merely present in exceptional manifestations, but is the essential cause and sustaining power of all beings.\n\nThe term 'bīja' (seed) is particularly significant as it indicates the causal potency from which all effects emerge. Just as a seed contains within itself the potential for the entire tree, Krishna as the cosmic seed contains within Himself the potential for all creation. This verse emphasizes both the immanence and transcendence of the Divine - He is within all things as their essential nature, yet all things depend upon Him for their very existence. The phrase 'carācaram' (moving and unmoving) encompasses the totality of creation, from conscious beings to inert matter.\n\nThis verse serves as a philosophical capstone to the Vibhūti Yoga chapter, transitioning from the enumeration of specific divine glories to the absolute statement of divine omnipresence. It prepares the ground for the Vishvarupa (cosmic form) revelation in the next chapter by establishing that everything in existence is fundamentally divine in nature. The verse reinforces the non-dualistic understanding that there is no existence separate from or independent of the Supreme Reality.",
