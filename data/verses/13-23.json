  "sanskrit": "उपद्रष्टानुमन्ता च भर्ता भोक्ता महेश्वरः।\nपरमात्मेति चाप्युक्तो देहेऽस्मिन्पुरुषः परः॥",
  "transliteration": "upadraṣṭānumantā ca bhartā bhoktā maheśvaraḥ |\nparamātmeti cāpy ukto dehe 'smin puruṣaḥ paraḥ ||",
  "translation": "The Supreme Spirit in this body is also called the Witness, the Permitter, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and the Supreme Self.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the Supreme Purusha (Paramatman) dwelling within the body using six distinct epithets, each revealing a different aspect of the Divine presence. As the Witness (upadraṣṭā), the Supreme observes all activities without attachment. As the Permitter (anumantā), it sanctions all actions through its mere presence. As the Supporter (bhartā), it sustains the entire existence. As the Experiencer (bhoktā), it is the ultimate enjoyer of all experiences, though remaining untouched by them. As the Great Lord (maheśvaraḥ), it is the supreme controller of all. And finally, as the Supreme Self (paramātman), it is the highest reality dwelling in all beings.\n\nThis verse is crucial in establishing the distinction between the individual soul (jīvātman) and the Supreme Soul (paramātman) while simultaneously revealing their intimate connection. Though both reside in the same body, the Supreme Self remains transcendent, untouched by the modifications of prakṛti (nature), while the individual soul becomes entangled in the guṇas. Understanding this distinction is essential for liberation, as it allows the seeker to recognize the eternal, unchanging witness within, distinct from the changing field of body and mind. This knowledge forms the foundation for discriminative wisdom (viveka) that leads to mokṣa.",
