  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations by identifying Himself with the most prominent members of various celestial categories. Among the twelve Adityas (sons of Aditi, representing the twelve solar deities corresponding to the twelve months), Krishna declares Himself to be Vishnu, who is considered the most important. Among all sources of light, He is the sun, which is the primary source of illumination and life on earth. Among the forty-nine Maruts (wind gods), He is Marichi, their leader. Among the stars and constellations, He is the moon, which is the most prominent and beloved celestial body in the night sky.\n\nThis verse illustrates Krishna's teaching methodology in the Vibhuti Yoga chapter - He identifies Himself with the most excellent, powerful, and beautiful manifestations in each category of existence. The purpose is not merely to list divine glories, but to train Arjuna's mind to see the Divine in all that is magnificent and worthy of reverence. By contemplating Krishna in these supreme manifestations, the devotee gradually develops the vision to perceive the Divine presence pervading all of creation. The verse also reflects the Vedic cosmology where celestial bodies and natural forces are personified as deities, and Krishna reveals Himself as the essence and supreme power behind all these divine manifestations.",
