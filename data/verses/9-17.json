  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna reveals His universal relationship with all beings and His manifestation as the essence of sacred knowledge. By declaring Himself as father, mother, sustainer (dhātā), and grandfather, Krishna establishes that He is the ultimate source, nourisher, and support of all existence. This familial imagery emphasizes the intimate and caring relationship between the Divine and creation, transcending the impersonal absolute to reveal a personal God who maintains all relationships.\n\nKrishna then identifies Himself as 'vedyam' (that which is to be known), indicating that He is the ultimate goal of all knowledge and spiritual inquiry. As 'pavitra' (the purifier), He is the means by which all impurities are removed. The sacred syllable Om (praṇava) is declared as His direct manifestation, representing the primordial sound from which all creation emerges. Furthermore, by identifying with the three principal Vedas—Rig, Sama, and Yajur—Krishna establishes that all scriptural knowledge, all rituals, all hymns, and all sacred wisdom ultimately point to and emanate from Him alone. This verse thus presents the complete dependence of the universe on the Supreme, both in terms of existence and knowledge, reinforcing the chapter's theme of recognizing the Divine as the ultimate reality behind all manifestations.",
