  "translation": "The deluded do not perceive the soul departing from the body, remaining in it, or enjoying sense objects while associated with the gunas (modes of nature). But those who possess the eye of knowledge can see it.",
  "commentary": "This verse highlights the fundamental difference between those who are spiritually awakened and those who remain in ignorance. Krishna explains that the embodied soul (jiva) undergoes three states: departing from the body at death (utkrāmantam), dwelling within the body during life (sthitam), and experiencing sense objects through the modes of nature (bhuñjānam guṇānvitam). The deluded (vimūḍhāḥ) - those whose understanding is clouded by ignorance and material identification - cannot perceive these subtle movements and states of the soul because they lack spiritual discrimination.\n\nIn contrast, those who have cultivated the 'eye of knowledge' (jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ) - spiritual vision developed through self-inquiry, meditation, and the guidance of scripture - can clearly perceive the soul's presence and activities. This knowledge-eye is not physical sight but the discriminative wisdom that can distinguish between the eternal soul and the temporary body-mind complex. This verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual education and practice in developing this inner vision, which is essential for liberation. It connects to the chapter's broader theme of understanding the Supreme Person by first understanding the individual soul's nature and its relationship with prakṛti (material nature) and the three gunas.",
