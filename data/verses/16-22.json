  "transliteration": "etair vimuktaḥ kaunteya tamo-dvārais tribhir naraḥ |\nācaraty ātmanaḥ śreyas tato yāti parāṁ gatim ||",
  "translation": "O son of Kunti, a person who is liberated from these three gates to darkness—lust, anger, and greed—performs actions conducive to self-realization and thereby attains the supreme goal.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents the positive outcome for one who overcomes the three gates to hell mentioned in the previous verse. Krishna addresses Arjuna as Kaunteya (son of Kunti) and explains that liberation from kāma (lust), krodha (anger), and lobha (greed) is not merely the avoidance of downfall, but the gateway to spiritual elevation. When a person frees themselves from these three destructive forces, they naturally begin to act in ways that benefit their true Self (ātmanaḥ śreyas), engaging in dharmic actions that lead to self-realization.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the transformative power of overcoming these base impulses. Once freed from the binding influence of desire, anger, and greed, a person's intelligence becomes clear and their actions spontaneously align with their highest good. This is not a passive state but an active engagement with life through the lens of wisdom and self-control. The phrase 'parāṁ gatim' (supreme goal) refers to moksha or liberation, the ultimate aim of human existence according to Vedantic philosophy.\n\nThis verse serves as an encouraging counterpoint to the warnings of the previous verse, showing that spiritual progress is accessible to those who consciously work to transcend their lower nature. It reinforces the central teaching of Chapter 16: that human beings have the choice between the divine and demoniac paths, and that choosing to overcome destructive tendencies leads naturally to the highest spiritual attainment.",
