  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to reveal His divine manifestations through various aspects of language, time, and cosmic function. Among all letters, He declares Himself to be 'A' (akāra), the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, which is fundamental to all other sounds and letters. This represents the primordial nature of the Divine as the source from which all else emerges. Among compound words (samāsa), He is the dvandva (dual compound), which represents equality and coordination between two elements, symbolizing the divine balance and harmony in creation.\n\nKrishna then identifies Himself as imperishable Time (akṣayaḥ kālaḥ), which is particularly significant as Time is the ultimate destroyer and transformer of all things in the material world. Yet this Time is described as 'akṣaya' (imperishable), indicating the eternal nature of the Divine that transcends even the destructive aspect of temporal existence. Finally, He declares Himself as the Sustainer (dhātā) with faces everywhere (viśvatomukhaḥ), indicating His omnipresence and His role as the supporter and maintainer of the entire universe. This imagery suggests that the Divine sees all, knows all, and sustains all from every direction simultaneously.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the all-pervading nature of the Divine in both the subtle realm of language and sound, and in the cosmic functions of time and sustenance. It reinforces the central teaching of this chapter that the Supreme Reality manifests as the most excellent and fundamental aspect of every category of existence, from the most abstract (letters and time) to the most concrete (the sustainer of all beings).",
