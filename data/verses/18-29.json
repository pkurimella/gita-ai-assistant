  "translation": "Now hear from Me, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), the threefold division of intellect and firmness according to the three gunas, which I shall explain exhaustively and distinctly.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as an introductory statement by Lord Krishna, preparing Arjuna for the detailed analysis of intellect (buddhi) and firmness or determination (dhṛti) according to the three gunas. Having already discussed the threefold divisions of knowledge, action, and the doer in the previous verses, Krishna now turns to two more crucial aspects of human psychology and spiritual practice. The intellect determines our understanding and discrimination, while firmness represents our willpower and steadfastness in pursuing our goals.\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in its promise of comprehensive and distinct explanation. Krishna uses the word 'aśeṣeṇa' (exhaustively) and 'pṛthaktvena' (distinctly), indicating that He will provide a complete and clear analysis that leaves no room for confusion. This systematic categorization is essential for spiritual aspirants to understand their own mental constitution and to recognize which qualities need to be cultivated and which need to be transcended. By understanding how intellect and determination function under the influence of sattva, rajas, and tamas, one can consciously work toward developing sattvic qualities that lead to liberation.",
