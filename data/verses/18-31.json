  "translation": "That intellect by which one understands incorrectly dharma and adharma, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done—that intellect, O Partha, is rajasic (passionate).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the nature of rajasic (passionate) intellect, which is characterized by distorted understanding and confusion. Unlike the sattvic intellect that perceives reality clearly and accurately, the rajasic intellect misapprehends fundamental principles of dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness), as well as what actions should be performed (karya) and what should be avoided (akarya). The key term 'ayathavat' (incorrectly, not as it truly is) indicates that this intellect perceives things in a perverted or distorted manner.\n\nThis type of intellect is dominated by rajas (passion, activity, desire), which clouds judgment and creates confusion about moral and ethical principles. A person with rajasic intellect may rationalize wrong actions as right, or may be unable to distinguish between duty and non-duty due to personal desires, ambitions, or emotional attachments. This leads to actions that bind one to the cycle of karma rather than liberating one from it. The rajasic intellect operates under the influence of likes and dislikes, personal gain, and ego-driven motivations, preventing clear discrimination between right and wrong.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18's discussion of the three gunas (qualities of nature) and their influence on various aspects of human life, this verse is part of Krishna's systematic analysis of how the three gunas affect buddhi (intellect). Understanding the nature of rajasic intellect helps spiritual aspirants recognize when their own judgment is clouded by passion and desire, enabling them to cultivate the sattvic intellect necessary for liberation.",
