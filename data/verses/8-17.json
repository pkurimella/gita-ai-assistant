  "transliteration": "sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ |\nrātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'horātra-vido janāḥ ||17||",
  "translation": "Those who know that Brahma's day lasts for a thousand yugas (ages) and that his night also extends for a thousand yugas—they are the true knowers of day and night.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the vast cosmic time scale of creation and dissolution. One day of Brahma (the creator deity) equals one thousand mahayugas (great ages), and his night is of equal duration. A single mahayuga consists of four yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali) totaling 4,320,000 human years. Therefore, one day of Brahma equals 4.32 billion human years, and his night is equally long. This cosmic day-night cycle represents the manifestation and dissolution of the entire universe.\n\nThis teaching serves multiple purposes in the context of Chapter 8. It helps aspirants understand the relative nature of time and the impermanence of even the highest material realms. Even Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahma, is subject to time and eventual dissolution. This knowledge encourages seekers to aim beyond all material realms, however exalted, and strive for the eternal, imperishable Brahman that transcends all temporal existence. The verse emphasizes that true wisdom lies not merely in knowing scriptural facts, but in understanding the transient nature of all material existence and directing one's consciousness toward the eternal.",
