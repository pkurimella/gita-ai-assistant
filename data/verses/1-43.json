  "transliteration": "utsanna-kula-dharmāṇāṁ manuṣyāṇāṁ janārdana |\nnarake 'niyataṁ vāso bhavatīty anuśuśruma ||43||",
  "translation": "O Janardana (Krishna), we have heard from the scriptures that those men whose family traditions are destroyed dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his argument against fighting by invoking scriptural authority. He addresses Krishna as Janardana (one who is worshipped by all people) and expresses his understanding that the destruction of family dharma leads to hellish consequences. Arjuna is citing traditional teachings he has learned, using the phrase 'anuśuśruma' (we have heard), indicating that this is received wisdom from sacred texts and teachers.\n\nArjuna's concern here reflects his deep anxiety about the cosmic and karmic consequences of the impending war. He believes that by killing his kinsmen, he will be responsible for the breakdown of family traditions and religious duties, which will result in prolonged suffering in hell not just for himself but for all involved. This verse demonstrates Arjuna's knowledge of dharmic principles, yet also reveals his confusion about how to apply them in this complex situation. His interpretation of dharma at this point is conventional and limited, focusing on external social structures rather than the deeper spiritual truths that Krishna will soon reveal.\n\nThis verse sets up one of the central tensions of the Gita: the conflict between conventional social-religious duty and higher spiritual wisdom. Arjuna's fear of hell and concern for family dharma, while seemingly righteous, actually stems from attachment, confusion, and a limited understanding of the eternal nature of the soul. Krishna's subsequent teachings will address these misconceptions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of dharma that transcends mere social convention.",
