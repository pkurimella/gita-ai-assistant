  "sanskrit": "पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवशोऽपि सः ।\nजिज्ञासुरपि योगस्य शब्दब्रह्मातिवर्तते ॥४४॥",
  "transliteration": "pūrvābhyāsena tenaiva hriyate hy avaśo'pi saḥ |\njijñāsur api yogasya śabda-brahmātivartate ||44||",
  "translation": "By virtue of that previous practice, he is carried forward automatically, even against his will. Even a mere inquirer of yoga transcends the ritualistic Vedic injunctions.",
  "commentary": "This verse reveals the powerful momentum created by sincere spiritual practice from previous lives. Krishna assures that the impressions (samskaras) of yoga practice from past births are never lost. These latent tendencies automatically draw the practitioner back toward spiritual pursuits, even if circumstances in the current life initially lead them elsewhere. The phrase 'carried forward automatically' (hriyate hy avaśaḥ) indicates that the spiritual seeker is propelled by an irresistible inner force born of previous yogic discipline.\n\nThe second half of the verse emphasizes that even one who merely inquires about yoga—who shows genuine curiosity and interest in the spiritual path—surpasses those who mechanically perform Vedic rituals without understanding their deeper purpose. The term 'śabda-brahma' refers to the ritualistic portion of the Vedas focused on ceremonial worship and material benefits. Krishna indicates that sincere inquiry into yoga, even without complete practice, is spiritually superior to mere ritual observance. This highlights the importance of genuine spiritual aspiration and the transformative power of even preliminary steps on the yogic path.\n\nThis verse provides great encouragement to spiritual seekers, assuring them that no effort in yoga is ever wasted. The accumulated merit and spiritual impressions from past practices create an invisible but powerful current that guides the soul back to its ultimate destination. This teaching addresses the concern raised earlier about the fate of the unsuccessful yogi, demonstrating that spiritual evolution continues across lifetimes with mathematical precision.",
