  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals His divine presence as the source of all luminosity in the universe. He identifies Himself as the essential light that manifests through the sun, moon, and fire. The sun's brilliance that illuminates the entire world, the moon's gentle glow, and fire's radiant energy all derive from His supreme effulgence. This teaching emphasizes that the Supreme Lord is not merely a distant creator but the very essence and sustaining power behind all natural phenomena.\n\nThis verse is part of a series where Krishna describes His immanent presence throughout creation while simultaneously maintaining His transcendence. By pointing to the most obvious sources of light and energy in the material world, Krishna helps Arjuna understand that divinity pervades all existence. The sun, moon, and fire were particularly significant in Vedic culture as objects of worship and symbols of divine power, yet Krishna clarifies that these are merely manifestations of His own radiance, not independent sources of power.\n\nPhilosophically, this verse establishes the non-dual relationship between the Supreme and His creation. While the light in these celestial and terrestrial objects appears distinct, it ultimately originates from the one divine source. This understanding helps spiritual seekers recognize the divine presence in nature and cultivate awareness of the Supreme in all manifestations of energy and consciousness, leading to a more integrated spiritual vision of reality.",
