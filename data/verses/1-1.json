  "translation": "Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjaya, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do when they assembled on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle?",
  "commentary": "This opening verse of the Bhagavad Gita sets the stage for the entire discourse. Spoken by the blind king Dhritarashtra to his charioteer and advisor Sanjaya, who has been granted divine vision to witness the battle, the verse reveals the king's anxiety about the impending war. The question appears simple, yet it carries deep psychological weight—Dhritarashtra knows his sons have usurped the kingdom from the rightful heirs, the Pandavas, and his inquiry betrays his inner conflict and foreboding about the outcome.\n\nThe significance of the term 'dharma-kṣetra' (field of dharma) is profound. Kurukshetra was not merely a battlefield but a sacred land where righteousness was to be established. This dual designation—both as a holy place and a battlefield—symbolizes the fundamental tension of the Gita: the conflict between material desires and spiritual duty. Dhritarashtra's use of possessive terms 'māmakāḥ' (mine) versus 'pāṇḍavāḥ' (Pandavas) reveals his partisan attachment and the root cause of the conflict—the sense of 'mine' and 'thine' that divides humanity.\n\nThis verse establishes the narrative framework for the philosophical teachings that follow. The external war at Kurukshetra becomes a metaphor for the internal battle between higher and lower natures within every human being. The question 'what did they do?' initiates not just a war chronicle, but a timeless dialogue on duty, righteousness, and the path to liberation.",
