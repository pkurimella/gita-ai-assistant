  "sanskrit": "यावत्सञ्जायते किञ्चित्सत्त्वं स्थावरजङ्गमम्।\nक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञसंयोगात्तद्विद्धि भरतर्षभ॥",
  "transliteration": "yāvat sañjāyate kiñcit sattvaṁ sthāvara-jaṅgamam |\nkṣetra-kṣetrajña-saṁyogāt tad viddhi bharatarṣabha ||",
  "translation": "Whatever being is born, whether moving or unmoving, know that it arises from the union between the field (kṣetra) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña), O best of the Bharatas.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides a comprehensive explanation of the origin of all manifest existence. He declares that every entity in creation, whether animate (jaṅgama) such as humans, animals, and insects, or inanimate (sthāvara) such as plants, mountains, and minerals, comes into being through the conjunction of matter (kṣetra) and consciousness (kṣetrajña). This union represents the fundamental principle underlying all manifestation in the phenomenal world.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the non-dual philosophy that pervades the Gita's teachings. While beings appear diverse and separate, they all share the same fundamental composition: the interplay between prakṛti (nature/matter) and puruṣa (consciousness/spirit). The field represents the material aspect including the body, mind, and senses, while the knower of the field is the eternal consciousness or ātman that witnesses and illuminates all experiences. This understanding is crucial for spiritual seekers as it reveals that the diversity of creation is merely a surface phenomenon, while the underlying reality involves the same two principles in varying combinations.\n\nBy addressing Arjuna as 'Bharatarṣabha' (best of the Bharatas), Krishna emphasizes the importance of this teaching for those seeking liberation. Understanding this principle helps the spiritual aspirant recognize that identification with the body-mind complex (the field) is the root cause of bondage, while realizing one's true nature as the kṣetrajña leads to freedom. This verse serves as a foundation for discriminative wisdom (viveka) that distinguishes between the eternal Self and the temporary modifications of matter.",
