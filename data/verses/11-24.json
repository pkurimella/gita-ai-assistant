  "sanskrit": "नभःस्पृशं दीप्तमनेकवर्णं व्यात्ताननं दीप्तविशालनेत्रम्।\nदृष्ट्वा हि त्वां प्रव्यथितान्तरात्मा धृतिं न विन्दामि शमं च विष्णो।।",
  "transliteration": "nabhaḥ-spṛśaṁ dīptam aneka-varṇaṁ vyāttānanaṁ dīpta-viśāla-netram |\ndṛṣṭvā hi tvāṁ pravyathitāntarātmā dhṛtiṁ na vindāmi śamaṁ ca viṣṇo ||",
  "translation": "Seeing You touching the sky, blazing with many colors, with mouths wide open and large fiery eyes—my inner self trembles in fear, and I find neither courage nor peace, O Vishnu!",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to express his overwhelming reaction to the cosmic form of Krishna. He describes the terrifying aspects of the universal form: its immensity touching the heavens, its brilliant multicolored radiance, its gaping mouths, and its enormous blazing eyes. These features represent the all-encompassing, all-consuming nature of cosmic reality that transcends human comprehension.\n\nArjuna's response is deeply visceral—his inner self (antarātmā) is shaken to its core. He confesses that he can find neither dhṛti (steadiness or courage) nor śama (peace or tranquility). This honest admission reveals the natural human response when confronted with the infinite and terrible aspects of divinity. Significantly, Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'Viṣṇo' (O Vishnu), recognizing the supreme preserving aspect of the divine even in this overwhelming vision.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the chapter's teaching about the limits of human perception when encountering the absolute reality. It demonstrates that divine vision, while a great blessing, can also be overwhelming and frightening. The verse prepares us for Arjuna's eventual plea to Krishna to return to his familiar, gentle form, reminding us that while God's cosmic nature is awe-inspiring, His personal, accessible form is what allows for loving devotion and relationship.",
