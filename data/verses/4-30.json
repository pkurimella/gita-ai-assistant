  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's exposition on various forms of sacrifice (yajña) by describing practitioners who perform prāṇāyāma or breath control as a form of sacrifice. Those who regulate their food intake (niyatāhārāḥ) and practice breath control are offering prāṇa (vital life force) into prāṇa itself, meaning they merge the outgoing breath with the incoming breath and vice versa through yogic practices. This represents a more internalized form of sacrifice compared to external ritual offerings.\n\nKrishna concludes this section by affirming that all these various practitioners—whether performing ritual sacrifices, austerities, yoga practices, or breath control—are knowers of sacrifice (yajña-vidaḥ). The common thread among all these diverse practices is that they purify the practitioner and destroy sins or impurities (kalmaṣa). This verse emphasizes that the essence of sacrifice lies not in its external form but in its purifying effect on consciousness. By recognizing multiple valid paths, Krishna demonstrates the inclusive nature of spiritual practice while maintaining that all authentic practices lead to the same goal of self-purification and liberation.",
