  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nkiṁ tad brahma kim adhyātmaṁ kiṁ karma puruṣottama |\nadhibhūtaṁ ca kiṁ proktam adhidaivaṁ kim ucyate ||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Supreme Person, what is that Brahman? What is Adhyatma (the individual self)? What is Karma (action)? What is said to be Adhibhuta (the material manifestation)? And what is called Adhidaiva (the cosmic gods)?",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Chapter 8, where Arjuna poses seven fundamental questions to Krishna. These questions arise from Krishna's concluding statements in Chapter 7, where He mentioned these technical terms without full explanation. Arjuna seeks clarification on five metaphysical concepts: Brahman (the Absolute Reality), Adhyatma (the individual soul or self-knowledge), Karma (action and its cosmic implications), Adhibhuta (the perishable physical nature), and Adhidaiva (the presiding deities or cosmic principles).\n\nThis inquiry demonstrates Arjuna's evolution as a spiritual seeker. He is no longer paralyzed by grief as in Chapter 1, but is actively seeking higher knowledge. The questions are methodical and comprehensive, covering the entire spectrum of spiritual philosophy from the absolute (Brahman) to the relative (material nature and action). Krishna's responses to these questions form the foundation of this chapter's teaching on attaining the Supreme at the time of death through proper remembrance and yoga practice. The verse sets the stage for one of the Gita's most important discussions on the imperishable Brahman and the path to liberation.",
