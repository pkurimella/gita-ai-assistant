  "transliteration": "śraddhāvāṁl labhate jñānaṁ tat-paraḥ saṁyatendriyaḥ |\njñānaṁ labdhvā parāṁ śāntim acireṇādhigacchati ||",
  "translation": "One who has faith, who is devoted to it, and who has controlled the senses, attains knowledge. Having attained knowledge, one quickly attains supreme peace.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the essential qualities required for attaining spiritual knowledge and the immediate result of such attainment. Krishna emphasizes three prerequisites: śraddhā (faith), tat-paraḥ (dedication or single-pointed devotion to knowledge), and saṁyatendriyaḥ (control over the senses). Faith here refers to a deep conviction in the teachings of the guru and scriptures, combined with earnestness in spiritual practice. Sense control is necessary because distracted senses pull the mind toward worldly objects, preventing the internalization of wisdom.\n\nThe verse promises that one who possesses these qualities will attain jñāna (spiritual knowledge or Self-realization). More significantly, Krishna assures that upon attaining this knowledge, supreme peace (parāṁ śāntim) follows swiftly (acireṇa). This peace is not temporary tranquility but the eternal peace of Self-realization, freedom from all suffering and the cycle of birth and death. This verse connects to the chapter's central theme of jñāna-yoga by outlining the practical path to knowledge and emphasizing that spiritual wisdom is not merely intellectual but transformative, leading directly to liberation and lasting peace.",
