  "transliteration": "om ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma vyāharan mām anusmaran | yaḥ prayāti tyajan dehaṁ sa yāti paramāṁ gatim ||",
  "translation": "Uttering the single syllable Om, which is Brahman, and remembering Me, one who departs leaving the body thus, attains the supreme goal.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the sacred practice of departing from the body while chanting the primordial sound Om and remembering the Divine. The syllable Om (praṇava) is described as 'ekākṣara' - the single, imperishable syllable that represents the entirety of Brahman. This monosyllabic mantra encompasses all of existence and serves as the sonic representation of the Ultimate Reality. By uttering Om at the time of death while simultaneously maintaining remembrance of the Lord, the practitioner ensures their consciousness is absorbed in the Divine.\n\nThis verse builds upon the previous teachings in Chapter 8 regarding the importance of one's final thoughts at death. Krishna emphasizes that the combination of the sacred utterance of Om with devotional remembrance (anusmaran) creates the perfect condition for liberation. The practice requires both jñāna (knowledge of Brahman as Om) and bhakti (loving remembrance of the personal Lord). This synthesis demonstrates that the impersonal Brahman and the personal God are not contradictory but complementary aspects of the same Ultimate Reality.\n\nThe 'paramāṁ gatim' or supreme goal refers to mokṣa - liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This verse has profound practical implications, as it establishes Om as the most sacred mantra for meditation and the ideal focus for consciousness at death. The practice described here is not merely for the moment of death but requires lifelong cultivation, so that remembering the Divine and chanting Om become natural and spontaneous even in the final moments of life.",
