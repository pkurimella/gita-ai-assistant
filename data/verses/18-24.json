  "transliteration": "yat tu kāmepsunā karma sāhaṅkāreṇa vā punaḥ |\nkriyate bahulāyāsaṁ tad rājasam udāhṛtam ||18.24||",
  "translation": "But that action which is performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify desires, and with egotism, is declared to be rajasic (passionate).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of rajasic (passionate) action, continuing His analysis of the three gunas as they apply to karma. Rajasic action is characterized by three primary features: it is motivated by desire (kāmepsunā), performed with ego and pride (sāhaṅkāreṇa), and requires excessive strain and effort (bahulāyāsam). Such actions are driven by the expectation of personal gain, recognition, or the fulfillment of selfish desires. The doer is attached to the fruits of action and performs work with a sense of 'I am the doer' rather than as an offering to the Divine.\n\nThis type of action stands in contrast to the sattvic action described in the previous verse, which is performed as a duty without attachment or ego. Rajasic action creates bondage because it reinforces the false identification with the ego and generates further desires. The excessive effort mentioned indicates not just physical strain, but also mental agitation and emotional turbulence that accompany desire-driven actions. Such actions may appear productive externally but lead to inner restlessness and perpetuate the cycle of karma.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18's comprehensive teaching on moksha through renunciation, this verse serves as a warning against actions performed in the mode of passion. While rajasic actions may yield temporary worldly success, they bind the soul to samsara and prevent spiritual liberation. Krishna guides Arjuna to recognize and transcend this mode of action, moving toward the sattvic and ultimately to action performed in pure consciousness, free from the influence of all three gunas.",
