  "translation": "One who restrains the organs of action but continues to dwell mentally on sense objects is self-deluded and is called a hypocrite (a pretender).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna warns against false renunciation and hypocrisy in spiritual practice. He describes a person who outwardly controls their physical senses and organs of action (karmendriyāṇi) but whose mind remains attached to and dwelling upon sense objects. Such a person merely performs an external show of restraint while internally harboring desires and attachments. This creates a fundamental disconnect between outer behavior and inner reality.\n\nKrishna calls such a person 'vimūḍhātmā' (one of deluded self) and 'mithyācāra' (a hypocrite or pretender). This verse is crucial in the context of Chapter 3, where Krishna is establishing the superiority of Karma Yoga over mere physical renunciation. He is preparing to introduce the concept that true spiritual practice involves performing one's duties with a controlled mind, rather than simply withdrawing from action while the mind remains uncontrolled. This teaching emphasizes that genuine spiritual progress requires internal transformation, not just external conformity.\n\nThe verse serves as a warning against self-deception in spiritual life. It establishes that mechanical control of the senses without corresponding mental discipline is not only ineffective but actually harmful to spiritual growth. True yoga requires harmony between thought and action, between the inner mental state and outer behavior. This principle becomes foundational for understanding the path of Karma Yoga that Krishna elaborates throughout this chapter.",
