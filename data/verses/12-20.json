  "transliteration": "ye tu dharmyāmṛtam idaṁ yathoktaṁ paryupāsate |\nśraddadhānā mat-paramā bhaktās te 'tīva me priyāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those who follow this immortal dharma as described above, endowed with faith, regarding Me as their supreme goal—those devotees are exceedingly dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 12 synthesizes all the qualities of the ideal devotee described in the preceding verses. Krishna declares that those who practice this 'dharmyāmṛtam'—this immortal, righteous nectar of devotional practice—with complete faith (śraddhā) and single-pointed focus on Him as their supreme destination, are most beloved to Him. The term 'yathoktam' (as described) refers to all the virtues enumerated in verses 13-19, indicating that the entire constellation of qualities forms the complete path of bhakti yoga.\n\nThe phrase 'mat-paramā' (having Me as supreme) emphasizes the exclusivity and totality of devotion required. These devotees do not merely practice spiritual disciplines mechanically, but do so with unwavering faith and the understanding that Krishna is their ultimate refuge and goal. The superlative 'atīva me priyāḥ' (exceedingly dear to Me) reveals the reciprocal nature of divine love—just as the devotee makes God supreme in their life, God holds such devotees in the highest regard. This verse beautifully encapsulates the essence of bhakti yoga: that devotion combined with virtuous living and steadfast faith creates the most intimate relationship between the individual soul and the Supreme.",
