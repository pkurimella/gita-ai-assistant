  "translation": "Given over to immeasurable anxieties ending only with death, regarding sense gratification as their highest aim, convinced that this is all there is.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of those possessed of demoniac qualities. Such individuals are perpetually consumed by countless anxieties and worries that persist until their death. Their mental state is characterized by constant agitation and fear, as they are deeply attached to worldly possessions and pleasures without any higher spiritual understanding. The phrase 'pralayāntām' (ending only at death) indicates that their anxieties are not temporary but persist throughout their entire lives.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that such people consider sense gratification (kāmopabhoga) as the supreme goal of life. They are firmly convinced that material enjoyment is the ultimate purpose of human existence, with no conception of higher spiritual truths or the immortal nature of the soul. This materialistic worldview keeps them bound to the cycle of desire and anxiety, preventing any spiritual evolution. Their philosophy is summed up in 'etāvad iti niścitāḥ' - they are certain that this material world and its pleasures are all that exists, rejecting any transcendental reality or higher purpose to life. This limited vision becomes the foundation of their demoniac nature and the source of their perpetual suffering.",
