  "sanskrit": "रुद्रादित्या वसवो ये च साध्या विश्वेऽश्विनौ मरुतश्चोष्मपाश्च |\nगन्धर्वयक्षासुरसिद्धसङ्घा वीक्षन्ते त्वां विस्मिताश्चैव सर्वे ॥२२॥",
  "transliteration": "rudrādityā vasavo ye ca sādhyā viśve'śvinau marutaścośmapāśca |\ngandharva-yakṣāsura-siddha-saṅghā vīkṣante tvāṁ vismitāścaiva sarve ||22||",
  "translation": "The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Vishvadevas, the two Ashvins, the Maruts, the Manes, and the hosts of Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras, and Siddhas—all these behold You in amazement.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his description of the cosmic beings witnessing Krishna's Universal Form. He enumerates various categories of celestial and supernatural beings from Vedic cosmology who are all gazing upon this magnificent vision with wonder and astonishment. The Rudras are forms of Shiva, the Adityas are solar deities, the Vasus are elemental gods, and the Sadhyas are a class of celestial beings. The Vishvadevas are universal gods, the Ashvins are divine physicians, and the Maruts are storm deities. The Ushmapas (Manes or Pitris) are the spirits of ancestors.\n\nThe verse also mentions Gandharvas (celestial musicians), Yakshas (nature spirits), Asuras (demons or anti-gods), and Siddhas (perfected beings). The fact that even these exalted beings—many of whom are themselves objects of worship—are looking upon Krishna's form with amazement (vismitāḥ) emphasizes the supreme magnificence and transcendence of the Vishvarupa. This comprehensive listing demonstrates that Krishna's universal form encompasses and transcends all levels of existence, from the highest gods to the perfected sages, and that even these elevated beings are awestruck by this revelation of ultimate reality. The verse reinforces the teaching that Krishna is the source and foundation of all beings in the cosmos.",
