  "sanskrit": "यातयामं गतरसं पूति पर्युषितं च यत्।\nउच्छिष्टमपि चामेध्यं भोजनं तामसप्रियम्॥",
  "transliteration": "yāta-yāmaṁ gata-rasaṁ pūti paryuṣitaṁ ca yat |\nucchiṣṭam api cāmedhyaṁ bhojanaṁ tāmasa-priyam ||",
  "translation": "Food that is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, refuse, and impure is dear to those in the mode of ignorance.",
  "commentary": "This verse completes Krishna's description of the three types of food preferred by people of different natures, focusing here on tamasic (ignorant) food. Such food includes items that are half-cooked or overcooked (yāta-yāma), devoid of natural taste and nutritional value (gata-rasa), foul-smelling (pūti), stale or decomposed (paryuṣita), leftover remnants (ucchiṣṭa), and impure or unclean (amedhya). These foods not only lack nutritional benefit but actively harm the body and mind, promoting disease, lethargy, and mental dullness.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 17's exploration of faith and its manifestations, this verse demonstrates how one's inner nature (guṇa) determines even basic choices like food preference. Those dominated by tamas are attracted to foods that increase darkness, inertia, and confusion. This is not merely about physical health but reflects a deeper spiritual condition. The Gita's teaching here is that spiritual aspirants should be mindful of their diet, as food directly influences consciousness. By avoiding tamasic foods and choosing sattvic ones, practitioners can purify their minds and bodies, making them more suitable vessels for spiritual practice and divine realization. This verse underscores the holistic nature of yoga, where every aspect of life, including diet, becomes a means of spiritual transformation.",
