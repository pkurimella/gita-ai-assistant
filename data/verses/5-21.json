  "sanskrit": "बाह्यस्पर्शेष्वसक्तात्मा विन्दत्यात्मनि यत्सुखम्।\nस ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा सुखमक्षयमश्नुते॥",
  "transliteration": "bāhya-sparśeṣv asaktātmā vindaty ātmani yat sukham |\nsa brahma-yoga-yuktātmā sukham akṣayam aśnute ||",
  "translation": "One whose mind is unattached to external sense objects finds happiness within the Self. Such a person, united with Brahman through yoga, attains imperishable bliss.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of one who has turned inward and discovered the supreme joy that exists within. Krishna explains that when the mind becomes detached from external sensory pleasures (bāhya-sparśa), it naturally discovers the infinite happiness that resides in the Self (ātman). This inner joy is fundamentally different from sensory pleasures, which are temporary and dependent on external objects and circumstances.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the practice of brahma-yoga, union with the Absolute Reality. When one's consciousness is established in this yoga, one experiences sukham akṣayam—imperishable, inexhaustible happiness. Unlike worldly pleasures that come and go, creating cycles of joy and sorrow, this spiritual bliss is eternal and unchanging. This state represents the culmination of the karma-sannyāsa yoga discussed throughout this chapter, where renunciation of attachment leads to the discovery of one's true nature.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of finding lasting fulfillment. Krishna is guiding Arjuna (and all seekers) away from dependence on external circumstances for happiness and toward the realization of the infinite bliss that is one's essential nature. This verse bridges the discussion of detached action with the ultimate goal of Self-realization, showing that true renunciation is not mere abandonment but the discovery of something infinitely greater.",
