  "translation": "All the worlds, O Arjuna, from the realm of Brahma downwards, are subject to return (rebirth). But having attained Me, O son of Kunti, there is no rebirth.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals a fundamental truth about the cosmic hierarchy and the nature of liberation. He explains that all realms of existence, including even the highest world of Brahma the Creator (Brahmaloka), are within the cycle of birth and death (samsara). Even beings who attain the exalted realm of Brahma through meritorious deeds and spiritual practices must eventually return to lower worlds when their accumulated merit is exhausted. This includes all the fourteen lokas or planes of existence recognized in Vedic cosmology.\n\nThe second half of the verse presents the stark contrast: those who attain Krishna—the Supreme Reality—transcend this cycle entirely. This attainment (upetya) refers to reaching the ultimate state of liberation (moksha) through devotion, knowledge, and yoga. Unlike temporary heavenly abodes that offer prolonged pleasure but not permanent freedom, union with the Supreme is eternal and irreversible. This verse emphasizes that true spiritual aspiration should not be directed toward temporary celestial rewards, however elevated, but toward the imperishable Supreme.\n\nThis teaching is central to the chapter's theme of understanding the imperishable Brahman and the path to ultimate liberation. Krishna is establishing the hierarchy of spiritual goals, showing that even the longest-lasting material existence is ultimately temporary and unsatisfactory compared to the eternal freedom found in union with the Divine. This verse serves as a powerful motivation for seekers to aim for the highest goal rather than being satisfied with intermediate spiritual achievements.",
