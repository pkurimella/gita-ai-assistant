  "transliteration": "tvam akṣaraṁ paramaṁ veditavyaṁ tvam asya viśvasya paraṁ nidhānam |\ntvam avyayaḥ śāśvata-dharma-goptā sanātanas tvaṁ puruṣo mato me ||18||",
  "translation": "You are the imperishable, the supreme Reality to be known. You are the ultimate refuge of this universe. You are the inexhaustible protector of eternal dharma. You are the primordial, eternal Purusha—this is my conviction.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his hymn of praise after witnessing Krishna's cosmic form. He recognizes Krishna as the Akshara (imperishable), the ultimate metaphysical reality that transcends all manifestation. Arjuna declares that Krishna is not merely a manifestation but the supreme object of knowledge itself (param veditavyam), the final truth that all spiritual seekers aspire to realize. As the 'param nidhanam' (ultimate refuge), Krishna is identified as both the source and the resting place of the entire universe.\n\nArjuna further acknowledges Krishna as the eternal guardian of dharma (śāśvata-dharma-goptā), emphasizing the divine role in maintaining cosmic and moral order throughout time. The term 'avyaya' (inexhaustible) indicates that despite being the protector and sustainer, Krishna remains undiminished and unchanging. By calling Krishna the 'sanātana puruṣa' (eternal person), Arjuna recognizes the personal aspect of the Supreme Reality, bridging the concepts of the impersonal Brahman and the personal God. This verse represents Arjuna's complete theological understanding, synthesizing the various aspects of divinity—the metaphysical absolute, the cosmic sustainer, the moral guardian, and the eternal person—all unified in Krishna's being.",
