  "translation": "By the grace of Vyasa, I have heard this supreme and most secret yoga directly from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, who Himself spoke it.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Sanjaya expresses his profound gratitude to Sage Vyasa for granting him the divine vision (divya-drishti) through which he was able to witness and hear the entire dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Sanjaya acknowledges that what he heard was not ordinary knowledge but the supreme secret (guhyam param) - the highest wisdom concerning yoga and spiritual realization.\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in establishing the authenticity and divine nature of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings. Sanjaya emphasizes that he heard this wisdom directly from Krishna, who is described as 'Yogeshvara' - the Supreme Lord of Yoga. This indicates that the teachings are not second-hand knowledge or philosophical speculation, but direct revelation from the Supreme Being Himself. The verse also highlights the importance of guru-kripa (grace of the teacher), as it was only through Vyasa's blessing that Sanjaya could perceive this divine discourse despite being physically distant from the battlefield.\n\nThis verse marks the beginning of the conclusion of the Gita, where Sanjaya will share his final reflections with King Dhritarashtra about the extraordinary dialogue he has witnessed. It reminds us that spiritual knowledge is transmitted through grace and that the Gita represents direct divine instruction, making it an authoritative scripture for spiritual seekers.",
