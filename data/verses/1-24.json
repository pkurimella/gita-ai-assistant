  "translation ": "Sanjaya said: O Bharata (Dhritarashtra), thus addressed by Gudakesha (Arjuna), Hrishikesha (Krishna) positioned the excellent chariot between the two armies. ",
  "commentary ": "This verse marks a pivotal moment in the narrative as Sanjaya describes Krishna's response to Arjuna's request. Krishna, addressed here as Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), complies with Arjuna's wish to position the chariot between the two armies. The use of the epithet Gudakesha for Arjuna, meaning 'conqueror of sleep' or 'thick-haired one,' is significant as it suggests his alertness and warrior prowess, which stands in stark contrast to the emotional breakdown he is about to experience.    The positioning of the chariot 'between the two armies' (senayorubhayormadhye) is both literal and symbolic. Physically, it places Arjuna in the perfect vantage point to survey both sides of the conflict. Symbolically, it represents the moral and emotional crossroads at which Arjuna finds himself—caught between duty and compassion, between his warrior dharma and his human emotions. This strategic positioning by Krishna sets the stage for Arjuna to confront the full reality of the impending battle, which will trigger his crisis of conscience and ultimately lead to Krishna's divine discourse. The verse demonstrates Krishna's role not just as a charioteer but as a guide who will help Arjuna navigate through his inner conflict. ",
