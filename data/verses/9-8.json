  "translation": "Controlling My own material nature (Prakriti), I send forth again and again this entire multitude of beings, who are helpless, being under the control of material nature.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the mechanics of cosmic creation and the relationship between the Divine, material nature (Prakriti), and individual beings. He reveals that while He remains the ultimate controller, the process of creation occurs through His material energy. The phrase 'again and again' (punaḥ punaḥ) refers to the cyclical nature of creation and dissolution that occurs perpetually in cosmic time. Krishna emphasizes that He is not bound by this process but rather orchestrates it through His will.\n\nThe verse highlights an important philosophical point about the helplessness (avaśa) of beings under the sway of Prakriti. Living entities are bound by the three gunas (modes) of material nature—sattva, rajas, and tamas—and act according to their conditioning. However, Krishna stands beyond this mechanism as the supreme controller who 'holds' or 'supports' (avaṣṭabhya) His own Prakriti. This establishes the non-dual yet distinct relationship between the Divine consciousness and material energy, a key concept in Vedantic philosophy. The verse prepares the ground for understanding how Krishna remains unattached to actions despite being the ultimate cause of all manifestation.",
