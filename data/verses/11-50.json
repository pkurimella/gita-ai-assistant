  "sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच\nइत्यर्जुनं वासुदेवस्तथोक्त्वा स्वकं रूपं दर्शयामास भूयः।\nआश्वासयामास च भीतमेनं भूत्वा पुनः सौम्यवपुर्महात्मा॥",
  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\nity arjunaṁ vāsudevas tathoktvā svakaṁ rūpaṁ darśayām āsa bhūyaḥ |\nāśvāsayām āsa ca bhītam enaṁ bhūtvā punaḥ saumya-vapur mahātmā ||",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Vasudeva (Krishna) again revealed His own form. The Great Soul, assuming once more His gentle form, consoled the frightened Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the transition from the terrifying cosmic vision back to Krishna's familiar, gentle form. Sanjaya, narrating the events to the blind king Dhritarashtra, describes how Krishna compassionately responds to Arjuna's distress. After witnessing the overwhelming universal form (Vishvarupa), Arjuna was filled with fear and trembling, unable to bear the intensity of that cosmic revelation.\n\nKrishna, addressed here as Vasudeva (son of Vasudeva) and Mahatma (Great Soul), demonstrates His divine compassion by resuming His saumya-vapu (gentle, pleasant form) - the beautiful four-armed form and then the familiar two-armed human form. This act of reassuming a comprehensible form serves to comfort and reassure Arjuna, showing that the Divine, though infinite and terrifying in Its cosmic aspect, is also intimately accessible and loving in Its personal manifestation.\n\nThe verse highlights an important theological principle in the Gita: while God's universal form represents His absolute, all-encompassing reality, His personal form represents His accessibility and grace. The transition from the cosmic to the personal form illustrates that devotion and relationship with the Divine require a form that the human heart and mind can approach with love rather than overwhelming fear. This prepares the ground for Krishna's subsequent teaching about the superiority of devotion (bhakti) over mere knowledge of the cosmic absolute.",
