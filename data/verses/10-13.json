  "transliteration": "āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve devarṣir nāradas tathā |\nasito devalo vyāsaḥ svayaṃ caiva bravīṣi me ||",
  "translation": "All the sages declare You thus—the divine sage Narada, as well as Asita, Devala, and Vyasa; and now You Yourself are telling me this.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna acknowledges the divine nature of Krishna by citing the testimony of great sages and seers who have recognized His supreme position. He mentions Narada, the celestial sage known for his devotion and wisdom; Asita, an ancient sage; Devala, a revered rishi; and Vyasa, the compiler of the Vedas and author of the Mahabharata itself. By invoking these authoritative sources, Arjuna demonstrates that his acceptance of Krishna's divinity is not based on blind faith but is supported by the testimony of realized souls throughout the ages.\n\nThis verse serves as Arjuna's response to Krishna's exposition of His divine glories in the preceding verses. Arjuna is essentially saying that what Krishna has revealed about Himself aligns perfectly with what the greatest spiritual authorities have proclaimed. The phrase 'svayaṃ caiva bravīṣi me' (and now You Yourself are telling me) is particularly significant—it shows that Arjuna is receiving direct confirmation from the Supreme Lord Himself, which validates all previous scriptural and sage testimony. This verse establishes the principle of accepting spiritual truth through three sources: śruti (revealed scripture), the words of realized saints, and direct revelation from the Divine.",
