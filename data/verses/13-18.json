  "sanskrit": "ज्योतिषामपि तज्ज्योतिस्तमसः परमुच्यते ।\nज्ञानं ज्ञेयं ज्ञानगम्यं हृदि सर्वस्य विष्ठितम् ॥१८॥",
  "transliteration": "jyotiṣām api taj jyotis tamasaḥ param ucyate |\njñānaṁ jñeyaṁ jñāna-gamyaṁ hṛdi sarvasya viṣṭhitam ||18||",
  "translation": "That is the Light of all lights, said to be beyond darkness. It is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge, seated in the hearts of all.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the supreme nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality that is the Knower of the Field (Kṣetrajña). He declares it to be the light that illuminates all other lights—the sun, moon, fire, and all sources of illumination derive their luminosity from this supreme consciousness. Being beyond darkness (tamas), it is pure consciousness itself, untouched by ignorance or material nature. This supreme reality transcends all dualities and limitations.\n\nKrishna then provides a threefold description of this ultimate reality: it is jñāna (knowledge itself, pure consciousness), jñeya (the object to be known, the goal of all inquiry), and jñāna-gamya (attainable through knowledge or wisdom). This indicates that the Supreme is both the means and the end—the process of knowing and that which is to be known are ultimately one. Most significantly, Krishna reveals that this supreme reality dwells in the hearts of all beings (hṛdi sarvasya viṣṭhitam), indicating the non-dual nature of existence where the individual self and the Supreme Self are essentially one. This verse establishes the accessibility of the Divine to all seekers, as it resides within as the innermost Self, waiting to be realized through proper knowledge and discrimination between the field and its knower.",
