  "commentary": "This verse describes the signs by which one can recognize the predominance of sattva guna in oneself. Krishna explains that when sattva increases, illumination and knowledge manifest through all the 'gates' or openings of the body—the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and other sense organs. This prakāśa (illumination) refers to clarity of perception, mental lucidity, and the ability to discriminate between right and wrong. The senses function with purity and are directed toward higher knowledge rather than mere sensory gratification.\n\nThe phrase 'all the gates of the body' is significant because it indicates a comprehensive transformation of one's entire being. When sattva predominates, there is harmony in thought, speech, and action. The mind becomes clear like a clean mirror, reflecting reality as it is without distortion. This state is characterized by inner peace, contentment, and the natural inclination toward wisdom and virtue. The verse serves as a practical diagnostic tool for spiritual aspirants to assess their inner state and understand which guna is currently influencing their consciousness. This self-awareness is crucial for spiritual progress, as it enables one to consciously cultivate sattva and transcend the influence of rajas and tamas.",
