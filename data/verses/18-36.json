  "transliteration": "sukhaṁ tv idānīṁ tri-vidhaṁ śṛṇu me bharatarṣabha |\nabhyāsād ramate yatra duḥkhāntaṁ ca nigacchati ||",
  "translation": "Now hear from Me, O best of the Bharatas, about the three types of happiness. That happiness which one enjoys through practice, and by which one reaches the end of sorrow.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna introduces the topic of the three types of happiness (sukha), continuing his systematic analysis of the threefold division based on the gunas. He addresses Arjuna as 'Bharatarshaba' (best of the Bharatas), preparing him to understand the subtle distinctions between different forms of happiness. This verse serves as an introduction to the classification that follows in the subsequent verses.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two key characteristics of true happiness: it is cultivated through practice (abhyāsa) and it leads to the end of suffering (duḥkhānta). This suggests that genuine happiness is not merely a fleeting pleasure but something that requires discipline and sustained effort to develop. The phrase 'duḥkhāntaṁ ca nigacchati' indicates that real happiness has the power to terminate sorrow permanently, distinguishing it from temporary pleasures that may provide momentary relief but do not address the root causes of suffering.\n\nThis introduction to the three types of happiness is significant in the context of Chapter 18's comprehensive teaching on moksha-sannyasa. Krishna is guiding Arjuna to understand that not all experiences of happiness are equal—some lead to liberation while others bind one further to samsara. This discrimination is essential for anyone seeking the highest goal of life, as it helps one make wise choices about where to direct one's efforts and what to cultivate in one's spiritual practice.",
