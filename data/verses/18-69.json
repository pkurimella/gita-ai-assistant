  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna declares the supreme position of one who teaches the Bhagavad Gita to devotees. This statement comes as Krishna concludes His instructions to Arjuna, emphasizing the immense value He places on those who propagate this sacred knowledge. The use of both present and future tenses (priya-kṛttamaḥ and bhavitā) indicates that this promise is eternal and unchanging—no one is currently dearer, nor will anyone ever be dearer in the future.\n\nThis verse highlights the principle that sharing spiritual knowledge is one of the highest forms of service to the Divine. The teacher of the Gita performs the greatest welfare work by helping others attain self-realization and liberation. Krishna's declaration serves as tremendous encouragement for those who dedicate themselves to spreading this wisdom. It also underscores the Gita's central message that devotional service, particularly in the form of sharing transcendental knowledge, is the most direct path to winning the Lord's love and grace.\n\nThe verse must be understood in context with the preceding verse (18.68) where Krishna describes the qualifications of such a teacher—one who teaches with supreme devotion. This is not merely academic instruction but teaching infused with love and devotion for both the Lord and humanity. The superlative expressions used (priya-kṛttamaḥ - 'most dear doer' and priyataraḥ - 'more dear') emphasize that this service stands above all other forms of devotion in Krishna's estimation.",
