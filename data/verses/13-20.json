  "sanskrit": "प्रकृतिं पुरुषं चैव विद्ध्यनादी उभावपि ।\nविकारांश्च गुणांश्चैव विद्धि प्रकृतिसम्भवान् ॥",
  "transliteration": "prakṛtiṁ puruṣaṁ caiva viddhy anādī ubhāv api |\nvikārāṁś ca guṇāṁś caiva viddhi prakṛti-sambhavān ||",
  "translation": "Know that both Prakriti (Nature/Matter) and Purusha (Spirit/Consciousness) are beginningless; and know also that all modifications and the three gunas (qualities) are born of Prakriti.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes a fundamental metaphysical principle of Sankhya philosophy that Krishna integrates into his teaching. Both Prakriti (the material principle, the field) and Purusha (the conscious principle, the knower of the field) are declared to be anādi—without beginning, eternal. This removes any question of one being created by the other or one being superior in terms of temporal existence. They represent two distinct but equally primordial aspects of reality.\n\nThe verse then clarifies the domain of Prakriti by stating that all vikāras (modifications, transformations, changes) and the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas—the fundamental qualities that constitute material nature) arise from Prakriti alone. This is crucial for understanding the relationship between consciousness and matter: while Purusha is the unchanging witness, all change, diversity, and the play of qualities belong entirely to the realm of Prakriti. This distinction helps the spiritual aspirant understand that the true Self (Purusha) remains untouched by the modifications of body and mind.\n\nThis teaching provides the foundation for discriminative knowledge (viveka) between the eternal Self and the changing phenomena of nature. By understanding that suffering, pleasure, birth, death, and all transformations belong to Prakriti while the Purusha remains ever-free, one can cultivate detachment and move toward liberation. This verse thus serves as a cornerstone for the entire chapter's exploration of the field and its knower.",
