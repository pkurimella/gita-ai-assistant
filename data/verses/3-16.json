  "translation": "O Arjuna, one who does not follow the wheel of creation thus set in motion, who lives in sin, indulging in the senses, lives in vain.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the consequences of not participating in the cosmic cycle of sacrifice (yajña) that he described in the previous verses. The 'wheel' (chakra) refers to the interdependent cycle of sacrifice, rain, food, and beings that sustains creation. One who enjoys the fruits of this natural order without contributing to it through righteous action and sacrifice is living a sinful and selfish life.\n\nKrishna characterizes such a person as 'aghāyu' (sinful), 'indriyārāma' (one who revels in sense gratification), and living 'mogham' (in vain or uselessly). This person takes from society and nature but gives nothing back, breaking the sacred covenant of mutual sustenance. They live only for personal pleasure, ignoring their dharmic duties and their role in the larger cosmic order. This verse serves as a strong warning against purely hedonistic living and emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duties within the interconnected web of existence.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in establishing that human life has a higher purpose beyond mere sense enjoyment. By not participating in the wheel of dharma through selfless action, one wastes the precious opportunity of human birth. This verse reinforces the central teaching of Karma Yoga - that action performed as one's duty, as an offering to the cosmic order, is essential for both individual spiritual progress and the maintenance of universal harmony.",
