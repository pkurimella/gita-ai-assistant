  "transliteration": "udārāḥ sarva evaite jñānī tv ātmaiva me matam |\nāsthitaḥ sa hi yuktātmā mām evānuttamāṁ gatim ||18||",
  "translation": "All these devotees are indeed noble, but the wise one (jnani) I consider as My very Self. For, being steadfast and united in spirit, he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna makes a profound distinction while honoring all devotees. He declares that while all four types of devotees mentioned in the previous verse (the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise) are noble and elevated souls, the jnani—the one who worships with wisdom and knowledge—is especially dear to Him. Krishna goes so far as to say that the jnani is His very Self (ātmaiva), indicating the complete identity and unity between the devotee and the Divine.\n\nThe reason for this supreme status is explained: the jnani, being yuktātmā (united in spirit, steadfast in yoga), is established in Krishna alone as the ultimate goal (anuttamāṁ gatim). Unlike the other three types who approach God with specific desires or needs, the wise devotee seeks nothing but God Himself. This devotee has transcended all dualistic notions and recognizes the non-dual reality. The relationship is one of complete absorption and identity, where the devotee sees no separation between himself and the Supreme.\n\nThis verse establishes the hierarchy of devotion based not on the worthiness of the devotees—all are noble—but on the degree of their realization and the purity of their motivation. The jnani represents the culmination of spiritual evolution, where devotion, knowledge, and realization merge into one. This teaching is central to the Gita's synthesis of different yogic paths, showing how jnana (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion) ultimately converge at the highest level of spiritual attainment.",
