  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna acknowledges Krishna's self-description as the Supreme Being and expresses his desire to witness the divine universal form (Viśvarūpa). After hearing Krishna's detailed explanation in the previous chapter about His divine manifestations and supreme nature, Arjuna's faith has been strengthened, and he now wishes to directly perceive what has been described to him. He addresses Krishna with two significant epithets: 'Parameśvara' (Supreme Lord) and 'Puruṣottama' (Supreme Person), indicating his recognition of Krishna's transcendental position.\n\nThis verse marks a crucial transition in the Gītā, where theoretical knowledge is about to transform into direct mystical experience. Arjuna's request demonstrates the natural progression of a spiritual seeker from hearing (śravaṇa) to desiring direct vision (darśana). His use of 'aiśvaram rūpam' (divine form) indicates he wishes to see Krishna's cosmic, universal aspect rather than just His human form. This sets the stage for one of the most dramatic revelations in all of Hindu scripture.\n\nThe verse also reflects the principle that divine vision is granted based on devotion and readiness. Arjuna's humble request, combined with his acknowledgment of Krishna's supreme position, shows the proper attitude of a disciple seeking higher spiritual experience. His desire arises not from mere curiosity but from genuine faith in Krishna's words and a longing for complete understanding of the divine nature.",
