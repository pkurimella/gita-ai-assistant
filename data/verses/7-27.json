  "translation": "O descendant of Bharata, O scorcher of foes, all living beings are born into delusion, bewildered by the dualities which arise from desire and aversion.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the fundamental cause of human ignorance and why beings fail to recognize the Divine. The root cause is identified as the pairs of opposites (dvandva) that arise from desire (icchā) and aversion (dveṣa). These dualities—pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor, success and failure—create a state of complete delusion (sammoha) that affects all beings from the moment of birth. This delusion prevents individuals from perceiving the true nature of reality and the Supreme Lord who pervades all existence.\n\nThis verse is crucial in the context of Chapter 7, where Krishna has been describing how rare it is for someone to truly know Him. Here He explains why this is so—not due to any limitation on His part, but because of the inherent conditioning that affects all embodied souls. The dualities born of attraction and repulsion create a veil of ignorance that obscures spiritual vision. This teaching sets up the following verse, which will describe those rare souls who transcend this delusion. The verse emphasizes that liberation requires going beyond the fundamental human tendency to be pulled by likes and dislikes, which keep consciousness trapped in the realm of duality rather than perceiving the underlying unity of existence.",
