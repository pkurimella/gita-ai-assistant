  "translation": "The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings to revolve by His Maya (divine power), as if mounted on a machine.",
  "commentary": "This profound verse reveals the ultimate relationship between the Supreme Lord and all living beings. Krishna explains that Ishvara (the Supreme Controller) resides in the heart of every creature, not merely as a passive witness but as the inner director of all activities. The metaphor of beings mounted on a machine (yantra) illustrates how all creatures are moved by the divine energy of Maya, operating according to their karmas and nature, yet ultimately under the supreme control of the Divine.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the omnipresence and immanence of God while simultaneously highlighting the limited autonomy of individual beings. The 'machine' represents the body-mind complex, which operates according to the three gunas and past karmic impressions. This teaching serves to cultivate humility and surrender, showing that despite our sense of individual agency, we are ultimately instruments in the hands of the Divine. It prepares Arjuna for the final instruction of complete surrender (sharanagati) that follows in the subsequent verses.\n\nThis verse is crucial in the context of Chapter 18's culminating teachings, as it bridges the discussion of various yogas and types of knowledge with the ultimate message of devotion and surrender. By understanding that the Lord dwells within and orchestrates all movements through Maya, the seeker is encouraged to align their will with the Divine will, recognizing their true position as dependent on the Supreme Reality.",
