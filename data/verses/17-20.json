  "sanskrit": "दातव्यमिति यद्दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे ।\nदेशे काले च पात्रे च तद्दानं सात्त्विकं स्मृतम् ॥",
  "transliteration": "dātavyam iti yad dānaṁ dīyate'nupakāriṇe |\ndeśe kāle ca pātre ca tad dānaṁ sāttvikaṁ smṛtam ||",
  "translation": "That charity which is given with the sense of duty, to one who does nothing in return, at the proper place and time, and to a worthy person—such charity is considered to be in the mode of goodness.",
  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's exposition on the three types of charity (dāna) corresponding to the three guṇas. Sāttvika charity is characterized by several essential qualities: it is given out of a sense of duty and righteousness (dātavyam iti) rather than for personal gain; it is offered to someone who cannot or will not reciprocate (anupakāriṇe); and it observes the proper considerations of place (deśa), time (kāla), and recipient (pātra). The giver does not expect anything in return, neither material benefits nor even gratitude.\n\nThe emphasis on proper place, time, and recipient indicates that sāttvika charity is not indiscriminate but wisely directed. The proper place might be a holy site or where the need is genuine; the proper time could be an auspicious occasion or moment of actual need; and the worthy recipient is one who will use the gift appropriately, such as a learned person, a spiritual seeker, or someone in genuine need. This verse establishes the highest standard of giving, where charity becomes a spiritual practice performed as one's dharma, free from ego and expectation, contributing to the giver's spiritual evolution while genuinely helping others.",
