  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate His divine manifestations across various categories of celestial beings and natural phenomena. Among the eleven Rudras (storm deities associated with destruction and transformation), Krishna identifies Himself as Shankara, another name for Lord Shiva, who represents the supreme form of the Rudras and embodies the principle of cosmic dissolution and regeneration. Among the Yakshas (nature spirits) and Rakshasas (demonic beings), He is Kubera, the treasurer of the gods and lord of wealth, representing prosperity and guardianship of divine treasures.\n\nKrishna then declares Himself to be Pavaka (Agni, the fire god) among the eight Vasus, who are elemental deities representing natural phenomena. Fire is chosen as it is the most dynamic and transformative of the elements, essential for Vedic rituals and symbolic of spiritual purification. Finally, among mountains, Krishna identifies with Mount Meru, the legendary golden mountain considered the axis mundi in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, around which all physical and metaphysical worlds are said to revolve. This verse illustrates how the Divine manifests as the most excellent, powerful, and central entity in each category of existence, helping devotees recognize the Supreme in all aspects of creation and directing their worship toward the highest manifestations of divine glory.",
