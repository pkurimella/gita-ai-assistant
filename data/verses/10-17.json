  "transliteration": "kathaṁ vidyām ahaṁ yogiṁs tvāṁ sadā paricintayan |\nkeṣu keṣu ca bhāveṣu cintyo'si bhagavan mayā ||",
  "translation": "How shall I know You, O Master of Yoga, by constant meditation? In what various forms or manifestations, O Blessed Lord, are You to be thought of by me?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his inquiry into Krishna's divine manifestations (vibhūtis). Having heard Krishna describe His glories in previous verses, Arjuna seeks practical guidance on how to meditate upon the Lord. He asks two fundamental questions: first, the method of knowing Krishna through continuous contemplation, and second, the specific forms and manifestations through which the Divine can be contemplated. This reveals Arjuna's sincere desire to establish a concrete meditation practice.\n\nArjuna addresses Krishna as 'yogin' (master of yoga), acknowledging His supreme mastery over all yogic powers and His ability to manifest in countless forms. The question 'keṣu keṣu ca bhāveṣu' (in what various forms) indicates Arjuna's recognition that the infinite Divine cannot be grasped in totality by the finite mind, and therefore needs specific focal points for meditation. This verse demonstrates the devotee's humility and eagerness to learn the practical aspects of divine contemplation.\n\nThis inquiry is significant in the context of Vibhūti Yoga as it prompts Krishna to elaborate further on His divine manifestations in the subsequent verses. Arjuna's question reflects the universal spiritual seeker's need for tangible objects of meditation while approaching the formless Absolute. It establishes the pedagogical framework where the teacher provides specific examples of the Divine's presence in the world, making the abstract concept of Brahman accessible to the practicing devotee.",
