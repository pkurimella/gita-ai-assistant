  "sanskrit": "एतां दृष्टिमवष्टभ्य नष्टात्मानोऽल्पबुद्धयः।\nप्रभवन्त्युग्रकर्माणः क्षयाय जगतोऽहिताः॥",
  "transliteration": "etāṁ dṛṣṭim avaṣṭabhya naṣṭātmāno'lpabuddhayaḥ |\nprabhavanty ugrakarmāṇaḥ kṣayāya jagato'hitāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Holding fast to this view, these lost souls of small understanding and cruel deeds arise as enemies of the world, working for its destruction.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the consequences of the demoniac mentality outlined in the previous verses. Those who embrace the atheistic, materialistic worldview become 'naṣṭātmānaḥ' - lost souls who have destroyed their own spiritual nature. Their intelligence remains stunted ('alpabuddhayaḥ') because they reject higher truths and divine principles. Such individuals engage in 'ugrakarmāṇaḥ' - terrible, cruel actions that cause widespread harm.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that these demoniac persons are not merely misguided individuals but active agents of destruction ('kṣayāya jagataḥ') who work against the welfare of the world ('ahitāḥ'). Their actions stem from their fundamental rejection of dharma, divine order, and moral accountability. Throughout history, such individuals have caused immense suffering through wars, exploitation, and environmental destruction, all justified by their materialistic philosophy that denies any higher purpose or divine justice.\n\nThis verse serves as a warning about the practical dangers of the demoniac qualities described earlier in the chapter. It shows that philosophical positions are not merely abstract ideas but have real-world consequences. The rejection of spiritual values and divine principles leads not just to personal degradation but to actions that threaten the entire world, making such individuals enemies of all creation.",
