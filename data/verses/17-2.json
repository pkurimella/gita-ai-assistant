  "sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच\nत्रिविधा भवति श्रद्धा देहिनां सा स्वभावजा।\nसात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति तां शृणु॥",
  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\ntrividhā bhavati śraddhā dehināṁ sā svabhāva-jā |\nsāttvikī rājasī caiva tāmasī ceti tāṁ śṛṇu ||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: The faith of embodied beings is of three kinds, born of their inherent nature—sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Hear now about these.",
  "commentary": "In response to Arjuna's question about those who worship with faith but without following scriptural injunctions, Krishna begins His discourse on the threefold nature of faith. He explains that faith (śraddhā) is not uniform but manifests in three distinct forms corresponding to the three guṇas (qualities of material nature). This faith arises from one's svabhāva (inherent nature), which has been shaped by past actions, tendencies, and the predominant guṇa operating within the individual.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that faith is intrinsic to all embodied beings and naturally takes on the coloring of the predominant guṇa in one's nature. Whether sattvic (pure and harmonious), rajasic (passionate and active), or tamasic (dark and inert), one's faith determines the objects of worship, the type of food consumed, the austerities performed, and the charity given. This verse sets the foundation for the entire chapter, which will elaborate on how these three types of faith manifest in various aspects of spiritual and material life.\n\nThe significance of this teaching lies in understanding that faith itself is not enough—the quality of faith matters. Even sincere faith, if rooted in ignorance or passion, leads to corresponding results. Krishna's invitation to 'hear' (śṛṇu) indicates the importance of this knowledge for spiritual discrimination and progress toward liberation.",
