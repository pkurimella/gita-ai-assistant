  "sanskrit": "मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना।\nमत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थितः॥",
  "transliteration": "mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā |\nmat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ ||",
  "translation": "By Me, in My unmanifest form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings exist in Me, but I do not exist in them.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna reveals the paradoxical nature of His relationship with creation. He declares that in His unmanifest form (avyakta-mūrti), He pervades the entire universe. This means that while He remains imperceptible to ordinary senses, His presence sustains all existence. All beings and objects have their existence within Him, depending upon Him for their very being, just as waves exist in the ocean.\n\nHowever, Krishna immediately presents an apparent contradiction: while all beings exist in Him, He does not exist in them. This is not a logical paradox but a description of transcendence. Though He pervades everything and everything depends on Him, He is not limited, confined, or affected by creation. He remains completely independent and untouched by the modifications, limitations, and imperfections of the material world. This illustrates the concept of simultaneous immanence and transcendence—God is both within all things and beyond all things.\n\nThis verse establishes the foundation for understanding the nature of divine omnipresence without pantheism. Krishna is not merely the sum total of creation, nor is He absent from it. He maintains His supreme, independent existence while simultaneously being the substratum of all that exists. This mystery is further elaborated in the next verse, where Krishna will present an even more astonishing perspective on this relationship.",
