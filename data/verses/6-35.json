  "transliteration": "śrī bhagavān uvāca |\nasaṁśayaṁ mahā-bāho mano durnigrahaṁ calam |\nabhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa ca gṛhyate ||35||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is restless and difficult to control. But by practice and by dispassion, O son of Kunti, it can be restrained.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna responds to Arjuna's concern about the difficulty of controlling the restless mind. Krishna acknowledges the truth of Arjuna's observation—the mind is indeed turbulent and extremely difficult to restrain. However, He does not leave Arjuna in despair but provides the solution through two essential means: abhyāsa (practice) and vairāgya (dispassion or detachment).\n\nAbhyāsa refers to the repeated, persistent effort to fix the mind on the chosen object of meditation, constantly bringing it back whenever it wanders. This requires patience, determination, and regularity in spiritual practice. Vairāgya means developing detachment from sense objects and worldly desires that constantly pull the mind outward. It involves cultivating discrimination between the eternal and the temporary, and gradually reducing one's attachment to fleeting pleasures.\n\nThis verse is pivotal in the Dhyana Yoga chapter as it provides practical guidance for meditation. Krishna's teaching here is realistic yet encouraging—He acknowledges the challenge while affirming that success is possible through the right methods. The combination of persistent practice and detachment forms the foundation of all yogic disciplines and represents a balanced approach to spiritual development, addressing both the positive cultivation of focus and the negative aspect of reducing distractions.",
