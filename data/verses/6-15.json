  "transliteration": "yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ yogī niyata-mānasaḥ |\nśāntiṁ nirvāṇa-paramāṁ mat-saṁsthām adhigacchati ||",
  "translation": "Thus always keeping the mind absorbed in Me, the yogi of disciplined mind attains the supreme peace of nirvana, which culminates in union with Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the ultimate fruit of the meditation practice outlined in the preceding verses. The yogi who consistently practices controlling the mind and keeping it fixed on the Supreme attains the highest peace—nirvana-paramam. This state is characterized as 'mat-samstha,' meaning established in Krishna or the Supreme Reality. The term 'nirvana' here refers not to annihilation but to the cessation of material existence and the attainment of spiritual perfection.\n\nThe phrase 'niyata-manasah' (disciplined mind) emphasizes that this supreme achievement is not accidental but the result of sustained practice and mental discipline. The yogi must constantly engage in the practice ('yuñjann evam sada') to maintain the mind's absorption in the Divine. This verse serves as the culmination of Krishna's instructions on meditation in this chapter, showing that proper yogic practice leads to the highest spiritual realization—union with the Supreme, which brings complete and lasting peace beyond all material disturbances.",
