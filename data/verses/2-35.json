  "translation": "The great warriors will think that you have withdrawn from battle out of fear. And those who have held you in high esteem will regard you as insignificant.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to appeal to Arjuna's sense of honor and reputation, employing a strategic argument that addresses the warrior's concern for public opinion. Krishna warns that the great warriors (mahā-rathāḥ) - the commanders and heroes on both sides of the battlefield - will misinterpret Arjuna's withdrawal from combat as cowardice rather than compassion or moral sensitivity. This misunderstanding would be particularly damaging given Arjuna's established reputation as one of the greatest archers and warriors of his time.\n\nThe verse highlights a crucial aspect of dharma for a Kshatriya: the maintenance of honor and reputation is not merely personal vanity but an essential component of one's social duty and effectiveness as a warrior-leader. Krishna points out that Arjuna's current high standing (bahu-mataḥ) among his peers would be reduced to insignificance (lāghavam) if he abandons his duty. This argument operates on the worldly level of social consequences, complementing Krishna's earlier philosophical arguments about the immortality of the soul. Krishna is systematically addressing Arjuna's crisis from multiple angles - philosophical, practical, and social - demonstrating the comprehensive nature of his teaching.",
