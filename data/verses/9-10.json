  "translation": "Under My supervision, Nature gives birth to all moving and non-moving beings; by this cause, O son of Kunti, the world revolves in cycles.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals His role as the supreme overseer of all creation. He explains that Prakṛti (Nature or primordial matter) operates under His watchful supervision (adhyakṣa), producing the entire universe with all its mobile and immobile beings. This establishes that while Prakṛti is the material cause of creation, Krishna as the Supreme Consciousness is the efficient cause—the director and witness who enables all manifestation.\n\nThe term 'sūyate' (gives birth to) indicates the continuous process of creation, and 'viparivartate' (revolves) suggests the cyclical nature of cosmic manifestation—creation, sustenance, and dissolution. Krishna emphasizes that He is not directly involved in the mechanical process of creation but serves as the presiding consciousness without which Prakṛti would remain inert. This is analogous to how a magnet causes iron filings to move without physically touching them.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the relationship between consciousness and matter in Vedantic philosophy. It resolves the apparent paradox of how the unchanging, actionless Brahman can be the cause of the ever-changing universe. Krishna remains untouched and unaffected by the processes of Nature, yet His mere presence—His witnessing consciousness—is sufficient to activate all cosmic functions. This teaching helps Arjuna understand that the Divine pervades and governs all existence while remaining transcendent to it.",
