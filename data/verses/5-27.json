  "commentary": "This verse marks a transition in Chapter 5 as Krishna begins to describe the practical techniques of meditation and breath control (pranayama) that lead to liberation. The verse outlines the preliminary steps of yogic meditation: sensory withdrawal (pratyahara) by shutting out external objects, fixing the gaze at the point between the eyebrows (the ajna chakra or third eye center), and regulating the breath by equalizing the prana (incoming breath) and apana (outgoing breath) within the nasal passages. These techniques help the practitioner achieve mental stillness and prepare for deeper states of meditation.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 5, which discusses karma-sannyasa (renunciation of action), this verse demonstrates that true renunciation is not merely external abandonment of duties, but an internal state achieved through disciplined yogic practice. By controlling the senses, gaze, and breath, the yogi withdraws from the distractions of the material world and turns inward toward Self-realization. This verse, along with the following verses, provides a bridge between the philosophical discussion of renunciation and the practical methodology of achieving it through meditation. The techniques described here are foundational practices in raja yoga and are essential for anyone seeking to transcend the bondage of karma and attain moksha (liberation).",
