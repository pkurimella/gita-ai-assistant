  "transliteration": "yathā sarvagataṁ saukṣmyād ākāśaṁ nopalipyate |\nsarvatrāvasthito dehe tathātmā nopalipyate ||32||",
  "translation": "Just as the all-pervading space is not tainted because of its subtlety, so the Self, though present everywhere in the body, is not tainted.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a profound analogy to illustrate the transcendental nature of the Atman (Self). Krishna compares the Self to space (akasha), which pervades everything yet remains untouched and unaffected by anything it contains. Just as space accommodates all objects, movements, and changes without being modified or contaminated by them due to its subtle nature, similarly the Self pervades the entire body and witnesses all physical and mental activities without being affected by them.\n\nThe key teaching here is that the Self remains eternally pure and untainted despite its apparent association with the body, mind, and senses. All the modifications, experiences, pleasures, pains, virtues, and vices belong to prakriti (nature) and its evolutes, not to the Self. This understanding is crucial for spiritual liberation because it helps the seeker recognize their true nature as distinct from the changing phenomena of body and mind. The verse emphasizes that contamination is impossible for the Self due to its subtle, transcendental nature—it is beyond the gunas and remains as the eternal witness consciousness.",
