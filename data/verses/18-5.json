  "sanskrit": "यज्ञदानतपःकर्म न त्याज्यं कार्यमेव तत् ।\nयज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् ॥५॥",
  "transliteration": "yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat |\nyajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām ||5||",
  "translation": "Acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should indeed be performed. Sacrifice, charity, and austerity are purifiers of the wise.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides clear guidance on which actions should never be renounced, even by those seeking liberation. He identifies three categories of essential spiritual practices: yajña (sacrifice or worship), dāna (charity or giving), and tapas (austerity or discipline). These three pillars of dharmic action are fundamental to spiritual evolution and should be maintained throughout one's life, regardless of one's stage of renunciation.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that these actions are not merely optional practices but are purifiers (pāvanāni) even for the wise and discriminating (manīṣiṇām). This is significant because it establishes that certain actions have inherent purifying value that transcends the ordinary binding nature of karma. These specific actions cleanse the mind, refine the intellect, and prepare the seeker for higher spiritual realization. The verse thus distinguishes between actions that bind and actions that liberate, setting the stage for Krishna's teaching on performing actions with the right attitude.\n\nThis teaching is particularly important in the context of Chapter 18, where Krishna is resolving the confusion between sannyāsa (renunciation of action) and tyāga (renunciation of the fruits of action). By declaring these three types of actions as essential and purifying, Krishna prevents a misunderstanding that might lead seekers to abandon all activity. Instead, he advocates for intelligent renunciation that maintains spiritually beneficial practices while releasing attachment to results.",
