  "sanskrit": "स एवायं मया तेऽद्य योगः प्रोक्तः पुरातनः।\nभक्तोऽसि मे सखा चेति रहस्यं ह्येतदुत्तमम्॥",
  "transliteration": "sa evāyaṁ mayā te'dya yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ |\nbhakto'si me sakhā ceti rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam ||",
  "translation": "That same ancient yoga has been declared by Me to you today, for you are My devotee and My friend; this is the supreme secret.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals why He is sharing this ancient wisdom with Arjuna specifically. After explaining in the previous verse how this knowledge was transmitted through the royal lineage but was lost over time, Krishna now declares that He is reviving this same ancient yoga for Arjuna. The two qualifications Krishna mentions—that Arjuna is His devotee (bhakta) and friend (sakha)—are significant, indicating that this knowledge requires both devotion and intimacy with the Divine to be properly understood and received.\n\nKrishna characterizes this teaching as 'rahasyam uttamam'—the supreme secret or mystery. This indicates that the knowledge being imparted is not ordinary philosophical discourse but profound spiritual wisdom that reveals the deepest truths about the nature of reality, the Divine, and the path to liberation. The term 'rahasya' suggests that this knowledge, while being shared, still requires the proper qualification and receptivity of the student. The friendship and devotion that Arjuna possesses make him the worthy recipient of this timeless wisdom, establishing the importance of the guru-disciple relationship based on love and trust in spiritual transmission.",
