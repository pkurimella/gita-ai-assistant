  "translation": "That person who abandons all desires and moves free from longing, without sense of 'mine' and without ego—such a person attains peace.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of the liberated soul who has transcended material desires. Krishna explains that true peace comes not from fulfilling desires, but from renouncing attachment to them entirely. The person who acts without craving for results, without possessiveness (nirmama), and without false identification with the body and ego (nirahaṅkāra) achieves lasting tranquility. This is the culmination of the teachings on sthitaprajña (the person of steady wisdom) that began in verse 2.55.\n\nThe verse emphasizes three key qualities: freedom from desires (kāma), freedom from possessiveness (mama), and freedom from ego (ahaṅkāra). These three are the primary obstacles to spiritual realization. When one operates without these limitations, one naturally attains śānti—not merely temporary happiness, but permanent peace that transcends all dualities of pleasure and pain.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 2, where Krishna has been instructing Arjuna on the nature of the eternal Self versus the temporary body, and the importance of performing one's duty without attachment to results. This verse serves as a practical description of how one who has internalized these teachings actually lives and experiences life—in complete freedom and peace, regardless of external circumstances.",
