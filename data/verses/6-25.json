  "sanskrit": "शनैः शनैरुपरमेद्बुद्ध्या धृतिगृहीतया।\nआत्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत्॥",
  "transliteration": "śanaiḥ śanair uparamed buddhyā dhṛti-gṛhītayā |\nātma-saṁsthaṁ manaḥ kṛtvā na kiñcid api cintayet ||",
  "translation": "Gradually, step by step, one should attain tranquility through the intellect held firmly by conviction. Having established the mind in the Self, one should think of nothing else.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides practical instruction on the gradual process of meditation and mental stabilization. The emphasis on 'gradually' (śanaiḥ śanaiḥ) is significant, as it acknowledges that mastery over the mind cannot be achieved suddenly but requires patient, persistent effort. The intellect (buddhi) must be firmly controlled by determination (dhṛti) to guide the restless mind toward stillness. This is not a forceful suppression but a gentle, steady redirection of mental energies.\n\nThe ultimate goal described here is to establish the mind completely in the Self (ātma-saṁstham). This means withdrawing attention from all external objects and mental modifications, focusing solely on one's true nature. The instruction to 'think of nothing else' does not mean making the mind blank, but rather maintaining unwavering attention on the Self alone, transcending all other thoughts and distractions. This verse builds upon the previous instructions in the chapter regarding posture and breath control, now addressing the subtler aspects of mental discipline.\n\nThis teaching is central to the practice of dhyana yoga and represents the culmination of the preparatory practices. Krishna emphasizes that this state of absorption is achieved through the combination of intelligent discrimination (buddhi) and steadfast perseverance (dhṛti). The verse serves as a bridge between the external practices of yoga and the internal realization of the Self, showing that meditation is both a gradual process and a state of complete absorption in one's true nature.",
