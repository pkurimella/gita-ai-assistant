  "translation": "Wherever there is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, and wherever there is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow, there will surely be prosperity, victory, glory, and righteousness—this is my conviction.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of the Bhagavad Gita is spoken by Sanjaya to the blind king Dhritarashtra, summarizing the entire teaching with profound prophetic insight. Sanjaya declares that wherever Krishna (yogeśvara—the master of all yogas) and Arjuna (the dedicated warrior-disciple) are united, there the four divine blessings—śrī (prosperity/wealth), vijaya (victory), bhūti (power/glory), and nīti (righteousness/morality)—will inevitably manifest. This represents the perfect union of the Divine and the human, the teacher and the taught, wisdom and action.\n\nThe verse carries deep symbolic significance beyond the immediate context of the Kurukshetra war. Krishna represents divine consciousness, supreme wisdom, and spiritual guidance, while Arjuna symbolizes the sincere seeker who surrenders to divine will and acts according to dharma. Their combination suggests that when divine grace meets human effort, when spiritual wisdom guides righteous action, success in all dimensions—material, moral, and spiritual—is assured. This is not merely a prediction about the war's outcome but a universal principle applicable to all spiritual aspirants.\n\nAs the final verse, it serves as Sanjaya's testimony to the transformative power of the divine dialogue he has witnessed. His conviction (matir mama) is based on direct perception of this sacred teaching. The verse thus encapsulates the Gita's essential message: that alignment with divine wisdom and dharmic action leads to ultimate fulfillment. It leaves readers with the assurance that the path taught by Krishna, when followed with Arjuna-like devotion and determination, guarantees spiritual victory and worldly prosperity in harmony.",
