  "commentary": "This verse serves as the concluding statement of Chapter 4, synthesizing the key teachings about karma yoga and jñāna (knowledge). Krishna declares that one who has renounced the fruits of actions through yoga (yoga-saṁnyasta-karmāṇam), whose doubts have been completely cut asunder by spiritual knowledge (jñāna-sañchinna-saṁśayam), and who is self-possessed or established in the Self (ātmavantam) is not bound by actions. This represents the culmination of the spiritual path described in this chapter.\n\nThe verse emphasizes three essential qualifications for liberation from karmic bondage: first, the practice of karma yoga where actions are performed without attachment to results; second, the acquisition of true knowledge that dispels all doubts about the nature of the Self and reality; and third, the establishment in Self-awareness. When these three conditions are met, actions become powerless to create bondage. The person continues to act in the world but remains untouched by the karmic consequences, much like a lotus leaf remains unaffected by water.\n\nThis teaching directly addresses Arjuna's initial confusion about whether to fight or renounce action. Krishna shows that the solution is neither blind action nor complete withdrawal, but rather enlightened action performed with knowledge and detachment. The verse encapsulates the essence of the Gita's practical philosophy: one can be active in the world while remaining spiritually free. By addressing Arjuna as 'Dhananjaya' (conqueror of wealth), Krishna reminds him of his capability to achieve this supreme state of freedom through disciplined practice and knowledge.",
