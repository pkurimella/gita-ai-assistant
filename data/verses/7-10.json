  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals His fundamental nature as the primordial source of all existence. He declares Himself to be the eternal seed (bīja) from which all beings spring forth. This seed is not temporal but sanātana—eternal and imperishable. Just as a seed contains within itself the potential for the entire tree, Krishna as the cosmic seed contains within Himself the potential for all manifestation. This establishes the non-dual relationship between the Creator and creation, where the divine essence pervades all existence.\n\nKrishna further elaborates by identifying Himself with the highest qualities in beings—He is the intelligence in the intelligent and the brilliance in the brilliant. This does not mean He is limited to these qualities, but rather that wherever excellence manifests, it is a reflection of His divine nature. The verse emphasizes that all positive attributes, powers, and capabilities that beings possess are not separate from the Divine but are expressions of His energy. This teaching helps the spiritual aspirant recognize the divine presence in all manifestations of excellence and virtue, thereby cultivating a vision of unity in diversity and preparing the mind for higher realization of the Supreme Reality that pervades all existence.",
