  "transliteration": "teṣām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ |\nnāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā ||",
  "translation": "Out of compassion for them alone, I, dwelling within their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of knowledge.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals His most intimate and compassionate relationship with His devotees. Having explained in the previous verse that He bestows buddhi-yoga (the yoga of wisdom) upon those who constantly worship Him with love, He now describes how He personally removes the darkness of ignorance from their hearts. This is a profound statement of divine grace, showing that the Supreme Lord Himself takes responsibility for the spiritual enlightenment of His sincere devotees.\n\nThe phrase 'ātma-bhāva-sthaḥ' (dwelling within their hearts) indicates that Krishna resides in the hearts of all beings as the inner controller (antaryāmin), but He actively manifests His grace only for those who seek Him with devotion. The 'lamp of knowledge' (jñāna-dīpa) represents the discriminative wisdom that dispels the darkness of ignorance (ajñāna-jam tamaḥ), which is the root cause of all suffering and bondage. This divine intervention is not arbitrary but is a response to the devotee's sincere effort and love.\n\nThis verse is significant in establishing the doctrine of divine grace in the Gita. While human effort (puruṣārtha) is essential, ultimate liberation comes through the compassionate intervention of the Divine. The verse assures devotees that their sincere practice will not go unrewarded, and that Krishna Himself will ensure their spiritual progress by removing the final obstacles to enlightenment. This teaching provides great encouragement to spiritual aspirants, showing that they are not alone in their journey but are supported by the Supreme Lord dwelling within.",
