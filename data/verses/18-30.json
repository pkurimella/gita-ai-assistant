  "sanskrit": "प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च कार्याकार्ये भयाभये।\nबन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी॥",
  "transliteration": "pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca kāryākārye bhayābhaye |\nbandhaṁ mokṣaṁ ca yā vetti buddhiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī ||",
  "translation": "That intellect which knows the path of action and the path of renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what binds and what liberates—that intellect, O Arjuna, is sattvic.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of sattvic (pure) intellect as part of His analysis of the three gunas applied to buddhi (intellect). A sattvic intellect possesses comprehensive discriminative knowledge across six pairs of opposites: pravṛtti (engagement/action) and nivṛtti (withdrawal/renunciation), kārya (duty/what should be done) and akārya (what should not be done), bhaya (fear/what is dangerous) and abhaya (fearlessness/what is safe), and bandha (bondage) and mokṣa (liberation). This intellect understands when to act and when to refrain, what actions lead to spiritual progress and which lead to degradation.\n\nThe sattvic intellect is characterized by clarity, wisdom, and proper discrimination. It comprehends the subtle distinctions between righteous and unrighteous action, understands the nature of true danger versus imagined fears, and most importantly, knows what leads to spiritual bondage and what leads to liberation. This knowledge is not merely theoretical but practical and experiential, guiding one's choices in daily life. Such an intellect naturally inclines toward dharma and spiritual evolution, making it an essential quality for anyone seeking self-realization. This verse is central to the Gita's teaching on the three gunas, showing how the quality of one's intellect determines one's spiritual trajectory and capacity for making choices that lead to freedom rather than further entanglement in material existence.",
