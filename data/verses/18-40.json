  "transliteration": "na tad asti pṛthivyāṁ vā divi deveṣu vā punaḥ |\nsattvaṁ prakṛti-jair muktaṁ yad ebhiḥ syāt tribhir guṇaiḥ ||",
  "translation": "There is no being on earth, or again in heaven among the gods, that is free from these three gunas (qualities) born of Prakriti (material nature).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna makes a universal declaration about the all-pervading nature of the three gunas—sattva, rajas, and tamas. He emphasizes that no entity, whether on earth (pṛthivyām), in the heavenly realms (divi), or even among the celestial beings (deveṣu), exists completely free from the influence of these three fundamental qualities of material nature. This statement establishes the comprehensive scope of Prakriti's influence over all manifest existence.\n\nThis verse serves as a crucial foundation for the subsequent discussion on the division of duties according to one's inherent nature (svabhāva) and the gunas. By establishing that all beings are subject to the three gunas in varying proportions, Krishna prepares to explain how different social orders and their respective duties arise naturally from these combinations. The verse underscores that even the gods are not exempt from this cosmic law, highlighting that liberation comes not from escaping the gunas through physical location or status, but through transcendental knowledge and devotion.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that the gunas are not merely psychological states but fundamental constituents of all manifest reality. This recognition helps the spiritual aspirant understand that one must work with one's inherent nature rather than against it, performing duties appropriate to one's guna composition while simultaneously cultivating detachment and devotion to transcend their binding influence.",
