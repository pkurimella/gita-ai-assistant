  "sanskrit": "नियतस्य तु संन्यासः कर्मणो नोपपद्यते।\nमोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः परिकीर्तितः॥",
  "transliteration": "niyatasya tu saṁnyāsaḥ karmaṇo nopapadyate |\nmohāt tasya parityāgas tāmasaḥ parikīrtitaḥ ||",
  "translation": "But the renunciation of prescribed duties is not proper. Abandoning them out of delusion is declared to be in the mode of ignorance (tamas).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins to clarify the proper understanding of renunciation (sannyasa) by first explaining what constitutes improper renunciation. He states that abandoning one's prescribed duties (niyata karma) is not true renunciation but rather a form of delusion. Prescribed duties refer to those actions that are obligatory according to one's position in life, stage of life, and inherent nature. These include essential responsibilities toward family, society, and one's own spiritual development.\n\nKrishna categorizes the abandonment of such duties out of confusion or delusion as tamasic (in the mode of ignorance). This is significant because it establishes that true renunciation is not about escaping responsibilities or avoiding action altogether. When someone gives up their duties because they find them difficult, inconvenient, or because they misunderstand the nature of spiritual life, they are acting from ignorance rather than wisdom. This verse sets the foundation for the subsequent verses where Krishna will explain the three types of renunciation according to the three gunas (modes of nature), helping Arjuna understand that authentic spiritual renunciation involves the right attitude toward action rather than the mere cessation of action.",
