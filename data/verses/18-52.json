  "translation": "Living in solitude, eating lightly, controlling speech, body and mind, ever engaged in meditation and yoga, and taking refuge in dispassion.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of the qualities and practices necessary for one who seeks to attain knowledge of the Self. It outlines the external and internal disciplines that support spiritual realization. Living in solitude (vivikta-sevī) helps minimize worldly distractions, while eating lightly (laghv-āśī) keeps the body and mind alert and suitable for meditation. Control over speech, body, and mind (yata-vāk-kāya-mānasaḥ) represents the comprehensive discipline of one's entire being.\n\nThe verse emphasizes constant engagement in dhyāna-yoga (meditation) as the primary practice, supported by vairāgya (dispassion or detachment). This dispassion is not mere suppression but a natural outcome of understanding the temporary nature of worldly objects and the supreme value of Self-realization. These practices form the foundation for the development of sattva guna and the eventual transcendence described in the previous verses. Together, they create the ideal conditions for the aspirant to progress toward the ultimate goal of moksha, which is the central theme of this final chapter of the Gita.",
