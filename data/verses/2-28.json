  "translation": "O Bharata (Arjuna), all beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their middle state, and unmanifest again in their end. What is there to grieve about in this?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents a profound philosophical argument to console Arjuna regarding the nature of existence. He explains that all beings emerge from an unmanifest state (before birth), become manifest during their lifetime, and return to the unmanifest state after death. This cyclical nature of existence is the fundamental law of material creation. The verse emphasizes that manifestation is merely a temporary phase between two states of non-manifestation.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Bharata' (descendant of Bharata), reminding him of his noble lineage and the wisdom expected of such a warrior. The rhetorical question at the end—'What is there to grieve about?'—challenges Arjuna's attachment to the temporary manifest forms of his relatives and teachers. If beings are unmanifest before and after their visible existence, then the visible form is merely a brief interlude in an eternal process.\n\nThis teaching connects to the broader theme of Chapter 2, where Krishna systematically dismantles Arjuna's grief by revealing the eternal nature of the Self (Atman) and the temporary nature of the body. The verse suggests that lamentation over death is illogical because it is simply a return to the original unmanifest state. This perspective encourages detachment from the physical form and recognition of the deeper, unchanging reality that transcends birth and death.",
