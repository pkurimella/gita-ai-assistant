  "sanskrit": "निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव।\nन च श्रेयोऽनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे॥",
  "transliteration": "nimittāni ca paśyāmi viparītāni keśava |\nna ca śreyo'nupaśyāmi hatvā svajanam āhave ||",
  "translation": "I see adverse omens, O Keshava (Krishna), and I do not foresee any good in killing my own kinsmen in battle.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to express his deep anguish and confusion on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He addresses Krishna as 'Keshava' (the slayer of the demon Keshi, or one with beautiful hair) and describes seeing inauspicious omens (nimittāni viparītāni) all around him. These omens are not merely external signs but reflect his inner turmoil and moral confusion. Arjuna's perception of adverse signs indicates his psychological state where everything appears contrary to success and righteousness.\n\nArjuna's statement that he cannot foresee any good (śreya) in killing his own relatives reveals the core of his moral dilemma. The word 'śreya' refers to the ultimate good or welfare, both material and spiritual. Despite being a warrior whose dharma is to fight for justice, Arjuna is overwhelmed by the prospect of fratricide. This verse is significant because it shows Arjuna's genuine concern for consequences and his inability to reconcile his duty as a warrior with his love for his kinsmen. His confusion sets the stage for Krishna's teachings that will form the essence of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThis verse represents a crucial moment in the narrative where Arjuna's dejection reaches its peak. His reference to omens and his inability to see any positive outcome demonstrate that he is seeking any justification to avoid the battle. This emotional and intellectual crisis becomes the catalyst for the profound philosophical discourse that follows, where Krishna will address not just the immediate situation but the fundamental questions of duty, action, and the nature of reality itself.",
