  "sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nकैर्लिङ्गैस्त्रीन्गुणानेतानतीतो भवति प्रभो ।\nकिमाचारः कथं चैतांस्त्रीन्गुणानतिवर्तते ॥२१॥",
  "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nkair liṅgais trīn guṇān etān atīto bhavati prabho |\nkim ācāraḥ kathaṃ caitāṃs trīn guṇān ativartate ||21||",
  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Lord, by what signs is one known who has transcended these three gunas? What is his conduct, and how does he go beyond these three gunas?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna poses three crucial questions to Krishna regarding one who has transcended the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas). First, he asks about the identifying marks or signs (liṅga) by which such a person can be recognized. Second, he inquires about the conduct or behavior (ācāra) of such an enlightened being. Third, he seeks to understand the method or process (katham) by which one actually transcends these fundamental qualities of material nature. These questions are practical and essential, as Arjuna wants to understand not just the theoretical knowledge of the gunas, but also how to identify and become a guṇātīta (one who has transcended the gunas).\n\nThis inquiry is significant within the context of Chapter 14, as Krishna has just finished explaining the nature and effects of the three gunas in detail. Arjuna's questions demonstrate his readiness to move from theoretical understanding to practical application. The questions reflect the concerns of any sincere spiritual aspirant: how to recognize spiritual advancement in oneself and others, what behavioral changes accompany such advancement, and most importantly, what practices lead to transcendence of material nature. Krishna's response to these questions in the following verses provides one of the most important descriptions of the liberated soul in the entire Bhagavad Gita, offering both philosophical insight and practical guidance for spiritual seekers.",
