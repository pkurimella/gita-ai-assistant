  "translation": "One who is united in yoga sees the Self present in all beings and all beings present in the Self. Such a person of equal vision sees the same everywhere.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the culminating vision of the yogi who has achieved perfection in meditation. Through sustained practice of yoga, the practitioner develops the ability to perceive the one Supreme Self (Atman) dwelling in all creatures, and simultaneously sees all beings as existing within that one universal Self. This is not merely an intellectual understanding but a direct experiential realization that transcends the apparent diversity of the material world.\n\nThe phrase 'yoga-yuktātmā' refers to one whose mind is firmly established in yoga, having achieved unity consciousness. Such a person develops 'sama-darśana' or equal vision - the ability to see beyond external differences of form, species, status, or condition, recognizing the same divine essence pervading all existence. This vision eliminates all sense of separation and otherness, leading to universal love and compassion. The yogi no longer sees fragmented, isolated beings but perceives the unified field of consciousness expressing itself through infinite forms. This realization is the foundation of true spiritual wisdom and the basis for selfless action in the world, as one who sees the Self everywhere cannot harm any being without harming oneself.",
