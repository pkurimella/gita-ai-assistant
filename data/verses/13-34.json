  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Distinction between the Field and the Knower of the Field",
  "sanskrit": "यथा प्रकाशयत्येकः कृत्स्नं लोकमिमं रविः |\nक्षेत्रं क्षेत्री तथा कृत्स्नं प्रकाशयति भारत ||",
  "transliteration": "yathā prakāśayaty ekaḥ kṛtsnaṁ lokam imaṁ raviḥ |\nkṣetraṁ kṣetrī tathā kṛtsnaṁ prakāśayati bhārata ||",
  "translation": "Just as the one sun illuminates this entire world, so does the Knower of the field (the Self) illuminate the entire field, O Bharata.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a beautiful analogy to illustrate the relationship between consciousness (kṣetrī) and matter (kṣetra). Just as a single sun, though one, illuminates the entire world and makes all objects visible, similarly the one Self or consciousness illuminates the entire field of matter, making all experiences possible. The sun does not become the objects it illuminates, nor is it affected by them; likewise, the Self remains distinct from and untouched by the field it illuminates.\n\nThis verse serves as the concluding teaching of Chapter 13, summarizing the essential distinction between the field and the knower of the field that has been elaborated throughout the chapter. The analogy emphasizes both the unity and transcendence of consciousness - it is one, yet it pervades and illuminates all experiences. The Self is the witness-consciousness that makes all perception, thought, and experience possible, yet remains forever unchanged by these modifications of prakṛti (nature).\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that just as darkness cannot exist where the sun shines, ignorance cannot persist where the light of Self-knowledge dawns. This verse encourages the seeker to discriminate between the illuminating consciousness (the true Self) and the illuminated objects (body-mind complex and the world), leading to liberation through knowledge of one's true nature as the eternal witness.",
