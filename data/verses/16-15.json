  "sanskrit": "आढ्योऽभिजनवानस्मि कोऽन्योऽस्ति सदृशो मया।\nयक्ष्ये दास्यामि मोदिष्य इत्यज्ञानविमोहिताः॥",
  "transliteration": "āḍhyo'bhijanavān asmi ko'nyo'sti sadṛśo mayā |\nyakṣye dāsyāmi modiṣya ity ajñāna-vimohitāḥ ||",
  "translation": "\"I am wealthy and born of noble family. Who else is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give charity, I shall rejoice\"—thus they are deluded by ignorance.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of the demoniac mentality by revealing the arrogant self-perception of those possessed by such qualities. The demoniac person boasts of their wealth (āḍhya) and high birth (abhijanavān), believing themselves to be superior and incomparable to others. Their pride blinds them to the reality that all material possessions and social positions are temporary and do not constitute true worth or spiritual advancement.\n\nThe verse highlights how such individuals may even perform religious activities like sacrifices (yajña) and charity (dāna), but these are done from ego and desire for recognition rather than genuine devotion or compassion. They perform these acts to \"rejoice\" or celebrate their own greatness, not out of duty or love for the Divine. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of dharma, where external religious observances are divorced from inner transformation and humility.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that all this arrogance stems from ajñāna-vimohitāḥ—being deluded by ignorance. This ignorance is not mere lack of information but a fundamental misidentification with the temporary body, wealth, and social status, forgetting one's true nature as the eternal soul. This delusion prevents spiritual progress and perpetuates the cycle of ego-driven actions that bind one to material existence. The verse serves as a warning against pride and the importance of cultivating humility on the spiritual path.",
