  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca |\nkāmyānāṁ karmaṇāṁ nyāsaṁ sannyāsaṁ kavayo viduḥ |\nsarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ prāhus tyāgaṁ vicakṣaṇāḥ ||",
  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: The wise understand sannyasa (renunciation) as the giving up of actions motivated by desire, while the learned declare tyaga (relinquishment) as the abandonment of the fruits of all actions.",
  "commentary": "In response to Arjuna's question about the distinction between sannyasa and tyaga, Krishna begins by presenting two different philosophical perspectives. The first view, held by certain wise seers (kavayaḥ), defines sannyasa as the complete renunciation of desire-motivated actions (kāmya karma)—those performed for personal gain or specific results. The second perspective, held by the discerning ones (vicakṣaṇāḥ), defines tyaga as the relinquishment of attachment to the fruits of all actions, while continuing to perform one's duties.\n\nThis verse sets up an important philosophical distinction that Krishna will elaborate upon in subsequent verses. The difference is subtle but significant: sannyasa involves giving up certain types of actions altogether, while tyaga involves performing actions without attachment to their results. This distinction is crucial for understanding the practical application of spiritual wisdom in daily life. Krishna presents both views objectively here before offering his own synthesis and clarification in the verses that follow.\n\nThe verse highlights a fundamental tension in Vedantic philosophy between the path of complete renunciation (often associated with the monastic life) and the path of action performed without attachment (karma yoga). By presenting both perspectives, Krishna demonstrates his comprehensive understanding of various spiritual traditions while preparing to guide Arjuna toward the most appropriate path for a person engaged in worldly duties.",
