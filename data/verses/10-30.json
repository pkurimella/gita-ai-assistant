  "translation": "Among the Daityas (demons), I am Prahlada; among calculators, I am Time; among beasts, I am the lion; and among birds, I am Garuda, the son of Vinata.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues to enumerate His divine manifestations across various categories of beings. Among the Daityas (descendants of Diti, often called demons or asuras), Krishna identifies Himself with Prahlada, the great devotee who remained steadfast in his devotion despite persecution by his own father, Hiranyakashipu. This is significant because Prahlada represents the highest spiritual qualities even among those born in demonic families, showing that devotion transcends birth and circumstance.\n\nKrishna then declares Himself as Time (kāla) among all things that measure or calculate. Time is the ultimate calculator and measurer, as it determines the duration of all existence and brings about the transformation of all things. This identification with Time connects to Krishna's cosmic form and His role as the destroyer of worlds. Among animals, He is the lion (mṛgendra), the king of beasts, representing strength, courage, and sovereignty. Among birds, He is Garuda (Vainatеya, son of Vinata), the divine eagle who serves as Vishnu's vehicle, symbolizing speed, power, and the ability to transcend limitations.\n\nThese manifestations illustrate Krishna's presence in the most excellent and powerful representatives of each category. The verse emphasizes that wherever there is exceptional devotion (Prahlada), supreme power over existence (Time), royal strength (lion), or divine swiftness and transcendence (Garuda), there Krishna's divine nature is most evident. This teaching helps devotees recognize the Divine in the world around them and cultivate awareness of God's all-pervading presence.",
