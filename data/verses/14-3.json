  "sanskrit": "मम योनिर्महद्ब्रह्म तस्मिन्गर्भं दधाम्यहम् ।\nसम्भवः सर्वभूतानां ततो भवति भारत ॥३॥",
  "transliteration": "mama yonir mahad brahma tasmin garbhaṁ dadhāmy aham |\nsambhavaḥ sarvabhūtānāṁ tato bhavati bhārata ||3||",
  "translation": "My womb is the great Brahman (Prakriti); in that I place the seed. From that, O Bharata (Arjuna), comes the birth of all beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the cosmic process of creation using the metaphor of procreation. He identifies Prakriti (primordial nature) as the great Brahman, which serves as the womb or matrix of all creation. Krishna, as the Supreme Consciousness, places the seed of consciousness into this cosmic womb, and from this union emerges all living beings. This imagery beautifully illustrates the relationship between Purusha (consciousness/spirit) and Prakriti (matter/nature) in the manifestation of the universe.\n\nThe verse establishes the foundation for understanding the three gunas (qualities of nature) that will be discussed throughout this chapter. All beings that emerge from this cosmic union are subject to the influence of the three gunas—sattva, rajas, and tamas—which are inherent properties of Prakriti. Krishna positions himself as the father who impregnates the mother (Prakriti) with consciousness, making him the ultimate source of all existence. This understanding is crucial for comprehending how individual souls become bound by the gunas and how they can transcend them.\n\nBy addressing Arjuna as 'Bharata' (descendant of Bharata), Krishna reminds him of his noble lineage while simultaneously teaching him about the universal lineage of all beings. This verse bridges the discussion from the previous chapter on the field and the knower of the field, now focusing specifically on how the material nature operates through the three gunas to create the diversity of life and experience in the manifest world.",
