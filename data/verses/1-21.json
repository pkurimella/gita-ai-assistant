  "sanskrit": "सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये रथं स्थापय मेऽच्युत ।\nयावदेतान्निरीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकामानवस्थितान् ॥",
  "transliteration": "senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta |\nyāvad etān nirīkṣe 'haṁ yoddhu-kāmān avasthitān ||",
  "translation": "O Acyuta (Krishna), please place my chariot between the two armies, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous of battle, with whom I must engage in this act of war.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'Acyuta' (the infallible one) and requests him to position his chariot between the two assembled armies. This request appears reasonable on the surface—a warrior wanting to survey the battlefield and assess his opponents before combat begins. However, this moment marks the beginning of Arjuna's moral crisis, as he is about to witness friends, relatives, and revered teachers arrayed against him.\n\nThe positioning of the chariot 'between the two armies' is symbolically significant in the Gita's narrative. It represents the moment of pause before action, the space of contemplation before decision. Arjuna wishes to see 'those desirous of battle' (yoddhu-kāmān), not yet realizing that this very act of seeing will precipitate his emotional collapse. This verse sets in motion the circumstances that will lead to Krishna's divine discourse, as Arjuna's direct confrontation with the reality of fighting his own kinsmen will soon overwhelm him with grief and confusion, creating the necessity for spiritual instruction.",
