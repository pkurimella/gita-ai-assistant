  "transliteration": "yayā svapnaṁ bhayaṁ śokaṁ viṣādaṁ madameva ca |\nna vimuñcati durmedhā dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha tāmasī ||35||",
  "translation": "That determination by which a person of dull understanding does not abandon excessive sleep, fear, grief, depression, and arrogance—that determination, O Partha, is of the nature of tamas (ignorance).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna concludes his analysis of the three types of determination (dhṛti) by describing tamasic determination. This is the lowest form of resolve, characterized by clinging to negative mental states and destructive patterns. The person with tamasic determination stubbornly persists in sleep, fear, sorrow, dejection, and pride—all of which are obstacles to spiritual progress. The term 'durmedhā' (dull understanding) indicates that such a person lacks the discrimination to recognize these states as harmful and therefore makes no effort to overcome them.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18's comprehensive analysis of the three guṇas (qualities of nature). Krishna is systematically showing how the three modes of material nature—sattva, rajas, and tamas—manifest in various aspects of human life, including determination. Tamasic determination is not true resolve but rather a stubborn attachment to ignorance and delusion. It represents the opposite of spiritual progress, as it binds one to lower consciousness through excessive sleep (spiritual lethargy), fear (lack of faith), grief and depression (dwelling in negativity), and arrogance (false ego).\n\nThe practical implication of this teaching is that spiritual aspirants must cultivate self-awareness to recognize when their determination is actually tamasic stubbornness. True spiritual determination (sattvic dhṛti) involves letting go of these negative states, not clinging to them. This verse serves as a warning against mistaking inertia and attachment to negative patterns for genuine resolve, encouraging seekers to elevate their consciousness from tamas through rajas to sattva.",
