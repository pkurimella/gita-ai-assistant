  "sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच\nएवमुक्त्वा ततो राजन्महायोगेश्वरो हरिः।\nदर्शयामास पार्थाय परमं रूपमैश्वरम्॥",
  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\nevam uktvā tato rājan mahāyogeśvaro hariḥ |\ndarśayām āsa pārthāya paramaṁ rūpam aiśvaram ||",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus, O King, the great Lord of Yoga, Hari (Krishna), then revealed to Arjuna His supreme divine form.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a crucial transition in the Bhagavad Gita, as Sanjaya narrates to the blind King Dhritarashtra the momentous event about to unfold. After granting Arjuna the divine vision in the previous verse, Krishna now actually reveals His cosmic form (Vishvarupa). The use of the term 'Mahayogeshvara' (great Lord of Yoga) is significant, indicating that Krishna is the supreme master of all yogic powers and can manifest His transcendental form at will.\n\nThe word 'Hari' is particularly meaningful here, as it refers to one who removes (harati) the darkness of ignorance and illusion. The 'paramam rupam aishvaram' (supreme divine form) that Krishna reveals is not His usual charming human form as Arjuna's charioteer, but rather the infinite, all-encompassing universal form that contains all of creation within it. This revelation represents the culmination of Arjuna's request to see Krishna's divine nature, moving from theoretical understanding to direct mystical experience. Sanjaya's narration emphasizes the extraordinary nature of this event, as he himself has been granted divine vision by Vyasa to witness and report these supernatural occurrences on the battlefield.",
