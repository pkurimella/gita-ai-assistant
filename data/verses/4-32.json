  "transliteration": "evaṁ bahu-vidhā yajñā vitatā brahmaṇo mukhe |\nkarma-jān viddhi tān sarvān evaṁ jñātvā vimokṣyase ||",
  "translation": "Thus, many kinds of sacrifices are spread out before the mouth of Brahman (in the Vedas). Know them all to be born of action. Knowing thus, you shall be liberated.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna concludes his extensive description of various types of yajñas (sacrifices) that he has been enumerating. He states that all these diverse forms of sacrifice are 'vitatā brahmaṇo mukhe' - spread out or expounded in the Vedas, which are considered the mouth of Brahman. These include material sacrifices, austerities, yoga practices, study of scriptures, and various forms of self-discipline mentioned in the preceding verses. The key teaching here is that all these sacrifices are 'karma-ja' - born of action, meaning they all involve some form of deliberate effort and engagement.\n\nThe profound message Krishna delivers is that understanding the true nature of these sacrifices leads to liberation (mokṣa). By recognizing that all forms of yajña are essentially actions performed with the right attitude and knowledge, one transcends the binding nature of karma. This verse emphasizes that liberation comes not merely from performing sacrifices, but from the wisdom of understanding their essential nature as actions dedicated to the Divine. This knowledge transforms ordinary actions into spiritual practices, making every deed a step toward freedom. The verse serves as a bridge between the discussion of various sacrifices and the upcoming emphasis on jñāna-yajña (sacrifice of knowledge) in the following verses.",
