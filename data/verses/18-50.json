  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna transitions to describing the culmination of spiritual practice - the attainment of Brahman realization. Having explained the path of action performed with proper understanding and detachment, Krishna now promises to teach Arjuna how one who has achieved perfection (siddhi) through such practice ultimately realizes Brahman, the Absolute Reality. The use of 'samāsena' (briefly) indicates that Krishna will provide a concise summary of this profound knowledge.\n\nThis verse serves as a bridge between the discussion of karma yoga and the description of jñāna niṣṭhā (steadfastness in knowledge) that follows. Krishna emphasizes that reaching Brahman is not merely theoretical knowledge but represents the highest culmination (parā niṣṭhā) of spiritual wisdom. The verse prepares Arjuna for the subsequent description of the qualities and practices of one established in transcendental knowledge, showing that perfection in action naturally leads to the realization of the Supreme.",
