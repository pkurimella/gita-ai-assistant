  "sanskrit": "असक्तबुद्धिः सर्वत्र जितात्मा विगतस्पृहः।\nनैष्कर्म्यसिद्धिं परमां संन्यासेनाधिगच्छति॥",
  "transliteration": "asakta-buddhiḥ sarvatra jitātmā vigata-spṛhaḥ |\nnaiskarmya-siddhiṁ paramāṁ saṁnyāsenādhigacchati ||",
  "translation": "One whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has conquered the self, and is free from desires, attains through renunciation the supreme perfection of freedom from action.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics and attainment of one who has perfected the path of renunciation (sannyasa). Krishna outlines three essential qualities: asakta-buddhi (unattached intellect), jita-atma (self-mastery), and vigata-spriha (freedom from desires). Such a person maintains equanimity in all circumstances, having transcended the pull of sensory objects and mental modifications. The unattached intellect does not identify with actions or their results, while self-conquest refers to complete mastery over the mind and senses.\n\nThe supreme state described here is naiskarmya-siddhi, the perfection of actionlessness or freedom from the bondage of karma. This does not mean cessation of all activity, but rather performing actions without creating karmic bondage. Through sannyasa—understood here not merely as external renunciation but as inner detachment—one realizes that the Self is never actually the doer. This verse is crucial in Chapter 18 as it presents the culmination of the renunciation teaching, showing how true sannyasa leads to liberation. It bridges the earlier discussion of the three gunas and prepares for the final teachings on complete surrender to the Divine, demonstrating that genuine renunciation is characterized by internal freedom rather than external abandonment of duties.",
