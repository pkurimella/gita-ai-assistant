  "translation": "Thus has this knowledge, more secret than all secrets, been declared to you by Me. Reflect upon it fully and completely, and then do as you wish.",
  "commentary": "This pivotal verse marks the conclusion of Krishna's teaching to Arjuna. Having imparted the supreme wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna now grants Arjuna complete freedom to choose his course of action. The phrase 'guhyād guhyataram' (more secret than all secrets) emphasizes that what has been taught represents the highest spiritual knowledge, surpassing all other forms of wisdom. This knowledge encompasses the entire teaching of the Gita, including karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnana yoga, and their synthesis.\n\nKrishna's instruction to 'vimṛśya' (reflect fully) demonstrates the importance of intellectual discrimination and personal understanding in spiritual life. The divine teacher does not impose His will but encourages Arjuna to contemplate deeply and arrive at his own conclusion. This reflects the fundamental principle that true spiritual growth comes from inner conviction rather than blind obedience. The phrase 'yathecchasi tathā kuru' (do as you wish) represents the ultimate respect for free will, even after receiving divine instruction.\n\nThis verse establishes the Gita's teaching methodology: complete transmission of knowledge followed by individual reflection and voluntary action. It shows that even divine guidance must be processed through one's own understanding and discrimination. Krishna has fulfilled His role as teacher; now the responsibility shifts to Arjuna to integrate this wisdom and make his choice. This verse serves as a bridge to the final and most confidential teaching that follows in the next verse.",
