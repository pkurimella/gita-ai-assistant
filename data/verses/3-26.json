  "sanskrit": "न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसङ्गिनाम्।\nजोषयेत्सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान्युक्तः समाचरन्॥",
  "transliteration": "na buddhi-bhedaṁ janayed ajñānāṁ karma-saṅginām |\njoṣayet sarva-karmāṇi vidvān yuktaḥ samācaran ||",
  "translation": "Let not the wise cause confusion in the understanding of the ignorant who are attached to action. The wise one, while performing all actions with devotion and in a disciplined manner, should inspire others to do the same.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides guidance on how the enlightened should interact with those who are still attached to the fruits of action. He advises that the wise should not create doubt or confusion (buddhi-bheda) in the minds of the ignorant (ajñāna) who are attached to action (karma-saṅgin). Rather than preaching renunciation of action to those unprepared for such knowledge, the wise should lead by example.\n\nThe second half of the verse emphasizes positive engagement. The enlightened person (vidvān) should encourage others to perform all their duties while themselves acting in a disciplined and devoted manner (yukta samācaran). This approach recognizes that different individuals are at different stages of spiritual evolution. Those attached to action need to continue working, but can be gradually elevated by observing how the wise perform action without attachment. This verse reflects Krishna's practical wisdom in spiritual pedagogy—meeting people where they are rather than imposing advanced teachings prematurely.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 3, where Krishna is establishing karma yoga as a valid path. He acknowledges that while knowledge and renunciation may be higher states, most people must progress through dedicated, selfless action. The wise should facilitate this progression through inspiration rather than creating confusion that might lead to inaction or despair.",
