  "translation": "He who, undeluded, thus knows Me as the Supreme Person (Purushottama), he, knowing all, worships Me with his whole being, O Bharata (Arjuna).",
  "commentary": "This verse represents the culmination of Krishna's teaching in this chapter about the Supreme Person (Purushottama). Krishna declares that one who truly understands Him as transcending both the perishable (kṣara) and the imperishable (akṣara), and as the Supreme Person beyond both, is free from delusion (asammūḍha). Such a person possesses complete knowledge (sarvavit) because knowing the Supreme Reality is the essence of all knowledge.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this knowledge naturally leads to complete devotion (bhakti). When one recognizes Krishna as Purushottama—the ultimate reality that pervades and transcends all existence—worship becomes spontaneous and all-encompassing (sarvabhāvena). This is not mere intellectual understanding but a transformative realization that engages one's entire being. The phrase 'sarvabhāvena' indicates worship with all emotions, thoughts, and actions dedicated to the Supreme.\n\nThis verse is significant in the Gita's overall philosophy as it synthesizes knowledge (jñāna) and devotion (bhakti). True knowledge of the Supreme Person is not dry intellectualism but naturally flowers into loving devotion. The undeluded person sees the divine presence in all aspects of existence and responds with complete surrender. This represents the highest spiritual attainment—recognizing and worshipping the Purushottama who is simultaneously immanent in creation and transcendent beyond it.",
