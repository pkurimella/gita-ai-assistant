  "translation": "For one who is free from attachment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, and who performs actions as sacrifice, all karma dissolves completely.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of a liberated person (jivanmukta) who performs actions without accumulating karmic bondage. Krishna explains that when a person is free from attachment (gatasaṅga), truly liberated in consciousness (mukta), and established in spiritual knowledge (jñānāvasthita-cetasaḥ), their actions become a form of sacrifice (yajña). Such a person acts in the world but remains untouched by the binding effects of karma.\n\nThe key teaching here is that it is not the action itself that binds, but the attitude and consciousness with which it is performed. When actions are performed as an offering to the Divine, without personal attachment to results, and with the understanding of one's true nature as distinct from the body-mind complex, all karma dissolves (pravilīyate). This verse synthesizes the chapter's central theme of karma-yoga—the path of selfless action performed with wisdom. It demonstrates how knowledge (jñāna) and action (karma) can be integrated, where the performer acts in the world while remaining inwardly free, thus transcending the cycle of action and reaction that binds ordinary individuals to samsara.",
