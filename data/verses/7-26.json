  "transliteration": "vedāhaṁ samatītāni vartamānāni cārjuna |\nbhaviṣyāṇi ca bhūtāni māṁ tu veda na kaścana ||",
  "translation": "I know all beings that have passed, those that are present, and those that are yet to come, O Arjuna, but no one truly knows Me.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Lord Krishna reveals His omniscience while simultaneously pointing to the mystery of His divine nature. Krishna declares that He possesses complete knowledge of all beings across the three divisions of time—past, present, and future. This establishes His transcendental position as the Supreme Being who exists beyond temporal limitations. His knowledge encompasses every creature that has ever existed, exists now, or will exist in the future, demonstrating His all-pervading consciousness and divine omniscience.\n\nThe second half of the verse presents a striking contrast: despite Krishna's complete knowledge of all beings, no one truly knows Him in His entirety. This apparent paradox highlights the fundamental difference between the finite and the infinite, the conditioned soul and the Supreme Reality. While Krishna, being the source of all consciousness, naturally knows all His manifestations, the conditioned beings, covered by ignorance (avidya) and the three gunas of material nature, cannot comprehend His transcendental nature. This verse sets up the explanation in subsequent verses about why beings fail to recognize the Divine—they are deluded by maya, the illusory energy of the Lord.\n\nThis verse is central to Chapter 7's theme of distinguishing between knowledge (jnana) and wisdom (vijnana). It emphasizes that while intellectual knowledge about God may be acquired, true realization of the Divine nature requires transcending the limitations of material consciousness. The verse also establishes Krishna's authority as the teacher of the Gita, as one who possesses complete knowledge and can guide Arjuna from ignorance to enlightenment.",
