  "transliteration": "dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā |\ntathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati ||",
  "translation": "Just as the embodied soul continuously passes through childhood, youth, and old age in this body, so does it pass into another body at death. The wise person is not deluded by this.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most fundamental teachings of the Bhagavad Gita regarding the nature of the soul and the body. Krishna uses a simple yet profound analogy to explain the concept of reincarnation. Just as a person experiences different stages of life—childhood, youth, and old age—within the same lifetime without losing their essential identity, similarly the soul transitions from one body to another at death. The changes in the body do not affect the eternal nature of the soul (dehin), which remains constant through all transformations.\n\nThe verse introduces the concept of the dhīra, the wise or steady person, who understands this truth and therefore remains undeluded. Such a person recognizes that death is merely a transition, similar to the transitions we experience within a single lifetime. This understanding is crucial for Arjuna, who is paralyzed by grief at the prospect of killing his relatives. Krishna is teaching him that the eternal soul cannot be killed; only the temporary body perishes.\n\nThis verse is foundational to the Sānkhya philosophy presented in this chapter, which distinguishes between the eternal, unchanging soul (ātman) and the temporary, ever-changing material body. By establishing this distinction, Krishna begins to address Arjuna's confusion and sorrow, showing that his attachment to bodily relationships and his fear of causing death are based on a misunderstanding of reality. The teaching encourages detachment from bodily identification and recognition of the soul's immortal nature.",
