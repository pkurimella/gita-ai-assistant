  "translation": "Being without beginning and devoid of qualities, this Supreme Self, though dwelling in the body, O son of Kunti, neither acts nor is tainted.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna explains the paradoxical nature of the Supreme Self (Paramatman). Though the Self appears to reside within the physical body, it remains completely untouched by the body's actions and experiences. The verse identifies three key attributes of the Self: it is beginningless (anāditva), without qualities or attributes (nirguṇatva), and imperishable (avyaya). Because of these characteristics, the Self transcends the realm of cause and effect that governs material nature.\n\nThe statement that the Self 'neither acts nor is tainted' resolves a fundamental philosophical question: how can the eternal, pure consciousness be present in a body that performs actions and experiences their consequences? Krishna clarifies that the Self's presence in the body is like space present in a pot—though seemingly contained, it remains fundamentally unaffected. This understanding is crucial for spiritual liberation, as it reveals that our true nature was never bound by karma or worldly experiences. The Self merely witnesses the play of prakṛti (nature) without participating in it, much like the sun illuminates activities without being involved in them. This verse forms a cornerstone of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, establishing the absolute transcendence of the Self beyond all material modifications.",
