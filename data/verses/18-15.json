  "translation": "Whatever action a person performs with the body, speech, or mind—whether right or wrong—these five are its causes.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his exposition on the five factors of action by explaining their universal applicability. He states that any action undertaken by a human being through the three instruments—body (śarīra), speech (vāk), and mind (manas)—necessarily involves all five factors previously mentioned: the seat of action (adhiṣṭhāna), the agent (kartā), the various instruments (karaṇa), the different kinds of efforts (ceṣṭā), and destiny or divine will (daiva). This applies whether the action is righteous (nyāyya) or unrighteous (viparīta), proper or improper.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse lies in its comprehensive analysis of action. Krishna is establishing that no action occurs in isolation or through a single cause. Every action, regardless of its moral quality, is the result of these five interdependent factors working together. This understanding is crucial for the teaching that follows regarding the nature of doership and agency. By recognizing that actions arise from multiple causes, one begins to see the limitations of claiming exclusive personal agency, which is a key step toward transcending ego-identification and achieving the wisdom that leads to liberation. This verse serves as a foundation for understanding karma-yoga and the proper attitude toward action in spiritual life.",
