  "translation": "O best of the Bharatas, I shall now describe to you the time (path) at which yogis departing (from this world) attain no return, and also the time at which they depart to return again.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna introduces an important teaching about the times or paths of departure from the physical body that determine whether a yogi returns to the material world or attains liberation. This verse serves as a preface to the following verses (8.24-26) where Krishna will elaborate on the bright path (śukla-gati) leading to non-return and the dark path (kṛṣṇa-gati) leading to rebirth. The word 'kāla' here refers not merely to chronological time but to the cosmic conditions and paths associated with departure from the body.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 8, which deals with the ultimate destination of the soul at death. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'Bharatarṣabha' (best of the Bharatas), indicating the importance of this knowledge. The verse distinguishes between two categories of departing souls: those who achieve 'anāvṛtti' (non-return, liberation) and those who experience 'āvṛtti' (return, rebirth). This classification is essential for understanding the different outcomes based on one's consciousness, practice, and the cosmic timing of departure. The knowledge being imparted here relates to the ancient Vedic understanding of the two paths - devayāna (path of the gods) and pitṛyāna (path of the ancestors).",
