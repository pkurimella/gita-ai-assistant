  "sanskrit": "धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् ।\nतत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥२५॥",
  "transliteration": "dhūmo rātris tathā kṛṣṇaḥ ṣaṇ-māsā dakṣiṇāyanam |\ntatra cāndramasaṁ jyotir yogī prāpya nivartate ||25||",
  "translation": "Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, and the six months of the southern course of the sun—departing in these, the yogi attains the lunar light and returns (to the mortal world).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the path of return, known as the Pitṛyāṇa or the path of the ancestors, in contrast to the path of no return described in the previous verse. Krishna explains that those who depart during inauspicious times—symbolized by smoke (as opposed to flame), night (as opposed to day), the dark fortnight (kṛṣṇa pakṣa), and the six months when the sun travels southward (dakṣiṇāyana)—follow a different trajectory after death. These yogis, though spiritually advanced, have not attained complete liberation and therefore reach the luminous realm of the moon (cāndramasa jyoti), which represents the heavenly worlds of enjoyment.\n\nThe lunar light or chandraloka represents the realm where souls enjoy the fruits of their meritorious karma. However, this is a temporary abode, and once the accumulated merit is exhausted, these souls must return to the mortal world (nivartate) to continue their spiritual evolution. This verse emphasizes the distinction between temporary heavenly enjoyment and permanent liberation (mokṣa). The symbolism of time periods—night, dark fortnight, and southern solstice—represents the quality of consciousness and spiritual preparation at the time of death, rather than literal astronomical moments. This teaching underscores the Gita's central message that only complete knowledge of and devotion to the Supreme leads to permanent liberation, while other spiritual practices, though beneficial, lead to temporary results.",
