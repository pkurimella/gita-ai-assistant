  "commentary": "This verse marks the conclusion of Krishna's direct teaching to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna summarizes that He has imparted the most profound and confidential knowledge (guhyād guhyataram) to Arjuna. The phrase 'more secret than all secrets' indicates the supreme nature of this wisdom, which encompasses the entire spiritual teaching including karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnana yoga, and ultimately the path of complete surrender to the Divine.\n\nSignificantly, Krishna does not impose His will upon Arjuna but respects his free will by saying 'yathecchasi tathā kuru' (do as you wish). This demonstrates a fundamental principle of spiritual teaching - that true wisdom must be contemplated deeply (vimṛśya) and integrated through one's own understanding and choice. Krishna asks Arjuna to reflect completely (aśeṣeṇa) on all that has been taught before making his decision. This verse emphasizes that spiritual knowledge is not meant to be blindly followed but thoroughly examined and personally realized before being acted upon, honoring the dignity and autonomy of the individual seeker.",
