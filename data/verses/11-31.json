  "transliteration": "ākhyāhi me ko bhavān ugra-rūpo namo 'stu te deva-vara prasīda |\nvijñātum icchāmi bhavantam ādyaṃ na hi prajānāmi tava pravṛttim ||31||",
  "translation": "Tell me who You are, so fierce in form. Salutations to You, O Supreme Lord! Be gracious! I wish to know You, the Primal Being, for I do not understand Your purpose or activity.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna, overwhelmed and terrified by the cosmic vision of Krishna's Universal Form (Vishvarupa), humbly requests the Lord to reveal His identity and purpose. Having witnessed the terrible and awe-inspiring aspect of divinity—where he has seen warriors, kings, and all beings rushing into Krishna's flaming mouths to be destroyed—Arjuna is both reverent and bewildered. He addresses Krishna with utmost respect as 'deva-vara' (Supreme among gods) and seeks His grace to understand this frightening manifestation.\n\nArjuna's question reflects the human predicament when confronted with the absolute reality of divine power that transcends conventional moral categories. The 'ugra-rūpa' (fierce form) represents the destructive aspect of time and cosmic dissolution, which operates beyond human comprehension. Arjuna recognizes that this is the 'ādya' (primordial, original) being, yet he cannot fathom the divine intention ('pravṛtti') behind this terrifying display. This verse marks a crucial moment in the chapter where Arjuna's initial desire to see Krishna's cosmic form transforms into an urgent need to understand the meaning behind the overwhelming vision.\n\nThe verse also illustrates an important spiritual principle: that direct experience of ultimate reality can be both illuminating and terrifying, requiring divine grace for proper understanding. Arjuna's humble approach—combining salutation, surrender, and sincere inquiry—demonstrates the appropriate attitude when seeking knowledge of the Absolute.",
