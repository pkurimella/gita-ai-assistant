  "sanskrit": "भवाप्ययौ हि भूतानां श्रुतौ विस्तरशो मया ।\nत्वत्तः कमलपत्राक्ष माहात्म्यमपि चाव्ययम् ॥",
  "transliteration": "bhavāpyayau hi bhūtānāṁ śrutau vistaraśo mayā |\ntvattaḥ kamala-patrākṣa māhātmyam api cāvyayam ||",
  "translation": "O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the origin and dissolution of beings, and also about Your imperishable glory.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna acknowledges that he has received comprehensive instruction from Krishna regarding the fundamental processes of creation and dissolution. He addresses Krishna as 'kamala-patrākṣa' (lotus-eyed one), a term of endearment and reverence that also symbolizes divine beauty and purity. Arjuna confirms his understanding of the cyclical nature of existence—how beings come into manifestation (bhava) and return to dissolution (apyaya)—concepts that Krishna has explained in previous chapters.\n\nArjuna also acknowledges that he has understood Krishna's imperishable glory (avyaya māhātmya), referring to the divine nature that transcends the cycles of creation and destruction. This verse serves as a bridge between the philosophical teachings Arjuna has received and his upcoming request to witness Krishna's cosmic form. Despite having received this knowledge intellectually, Arjuna now expresses a desire for direct experiential vision, which sets the stage for the magnificent revelation of the Viśvarūpa (Universal Form) that follows in this chapter.\n\nThis verse demonstrates the progression in spiritual understanding from intellectual comprehension to the yearning for direct perception. Arjuna's acknowledgment shows he has grasped the teachings, yet he seeks something beyond conceptual knowledge—a direct vision of the divine reality that Krishna has been describing throughout their dialogue.",
