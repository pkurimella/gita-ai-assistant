  "transliteration": "yataḥ pravṛttir bhūtānāṃ yena sarvam idaṃ tatam |\nsvakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhiṃ vindati mānavaḥ ||",
  "translation": "From whom all beings originate and by whom all this universe is pervaded—by worshipping Him through the performance of one's own duty, a human being attains perfection.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a profound synthesis of devotion (bhakti) and duty (karma). Krishna teaches that the Supreme Being is both the source of all existence (yataḥ pravṛttir bhūtānāṃ) and the all-pervading reality (yena sarvam idaṃ tatam). The path to perfection (siddhi) lies not in abandoning one's duties but in performing them as an act of worship to the Divine. This transforms ordinary work into a spiritual practice.\n\nThe key instruction here is 'svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya'—worshipping God through one's own prescribed duties. This builds upon the earlier teaching about svadharma (one's own duty) and connects it to the highest spiritual goal. Rather than seeking extraordinary means of worship, one should sanctify their natural duties by offering them to the Divine. This makes spirituality accessible to all, regardless of their station in life, as every person can transform their work into worship.\n\nThis verse is central to the Gita's practical philosophy, resolving the apparent conflict between worldly engagement and spiritual aspiration. It establishes that moksha (liberation) is not separate from dharma (duty) but is achieved through it when performed with the right attitude of devotion and surrender. This teaching democratizes spirituality, showing that perfection is attainable through sincere performance of one's natural duties rather than through renunciation of action.",
