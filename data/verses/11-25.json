  "sanskrit": "दंष्ट्राकरालानि च ते मुखानि दृष्ट्वैव कालानलसन्निभानि।\nदिशो न जाने न लभे च शर्म प्रसीद देवेश जगन्निवास।।",
  "transliteration": "daṃṣṭrā-karālāni ca te mukhāni dṛṣṭvaiva kālānala-sannibhāni |\ndiśo na jāne na labhe ca śarma prasīda deveśa jagan-nivāsa ||",
  "translation": "Seeing Your mouths, terrible with fangs, blazing like the fires of cosmic dissolution, I lose all sense of direction and find no peace. Have mercy, O Lord of gods, O abode of the universe!",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues to express his overwhelming terror at witnessing Krishna's cosmic form. The imagery becomes increasingly intense as he describes the Lord's mouths as fearsome with protruding fangs (daṃṣṭrā-karālāni), blazing like the fires of universal destruction (kālānala). This vision represents the destructive aspect of divinity, the dissolution that must accompany creation in the cosmic cycle.\n\nArjuna's psychological state deteriorates further—he loses his sense of direction (diśo na jāne) and cannot find any peace or comfort (na labhe ca śarma). This disorientation represents the human inability to comprehend the totality of divine reality, especially its terrifying aspects. The vision of God as the destroyer, as Time itself consuming all beings, is too overwhelming for the limited human consciousness to bear.\n\nIn his distress, Arjuna appeals to Krishna using exalted titles—Deveśa (Lord of gods) and Jagan-nivāsa (abode of the universe)—pleading for mercy and grace. This verse illustrates an important spiritual truth: while the seeker may aspire to know the ultimate reality, the actual vision of the Divine in its fullness can be terrifying and disorienting. It emphasizes the need for divine grace and the gradual preparation of the aspirant before such revelations. The verse also foreshadows Arjuna's eventual request for Krishna to return to his familiar, gentle form.",
