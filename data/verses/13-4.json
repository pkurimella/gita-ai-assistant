  "sanskrit": "ऋषिभिर्बहुधा गीतं छन्दोभिर्विविधैः पृथक् ।\nब्रह्मसूत्रपदैश्चैव हेतुमद्भिर्विनिश्चितैः ॥४॥",
  "transliteration": "ṛṣibhir bahudhā gītaṁ chandobhir vividhaiḥ pṛthak |\nbrahmasūtrapadaiś caiva hetumadbhir viniścitaiḥ ||4||",
  "translation": "This knowledge has been sung by the seers in many ways, in various distinctive hymns and Vedic chants, and also in the well-reasoned and conclusive verses of the Brahma Sutras.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the authority and authenticity of the knowledge He is about to impart regarding the field (kṣetra) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña). He references three sources of validation: the teachings of ancient seers (ṛṣis), the various Vedic hymns and meters (chandas), and the systematic philosophical treatises, particularly the Brahma Sutras. This triple validation demonstrates that the wisdom being shared is not novel or arbitrary, but rather represents the accumulated understanding of India's spiritual tradition.\n\nThe reference to the Brahma Sutras is particularly significant, as these aphorisms by Vyasa represent a systematic and logical exposition of Vedantic philosophy. By citing these 'hetumadbhiḥ' (well-reasoned) and 'viniścitaiḥ' (conclusive) statements, Krishna emphasizes that this knowledge is not merely based on faith or revelation alone, but is also supported by rigorous philosophical reasoning. This verse serves to assure Arjuna that the profound teachings about the distinction between matter and spirit, body and soul, have been thoroughly examined and validated by the greatest minds of the tradition.\n\nThis verse also reflects the pedagogical approach of the Gita, which harmonizes śruti (revealed scripture), yukti (logical reasoning), and anubhava (direct experience). By grounding His teachings in established authority while promising to explain them clearly, Krishna prepares Arjuna to receive this crucial knowledge with both faith and intellectual understanding.",
