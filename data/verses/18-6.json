  "translation": "However, even these prescribed duties should be performed without attachment and desire for results. This, O Partha, is My definite and supreme conviction.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides His conclusive teaching on the question of renunciation that Arjuna raised at the beginning of this chapter. After discussing various perspectives on sannyasa and tyaga in the previous verses, Krishna now declares His definitive position. He states that essential duties such as sacrifice (yajña), charity (dāna), and austerity (tapas) mentioned in the previous verse should never be abandoned, but must be performed with the right attitude—free from attachment (saṅga) and without desire for the fruits (phala) of action.\n\nThis verse represents the essence of Karma Yoga, which Krishna has been teaching throughout the Gita. The emphasis is not on abandoning action itself, but on renouncing the sense of personal ownership and expectation of results. By using the phrase 'niścitaṁ matam uttamam' (My definite and supreme conviction), Krishna gives this teaching the highest authority, indicating that this is not merely one option among many, but the most excellent path for spiritual aspirants who must continue to engage with the world.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this teaching lies in its practical applicability. Unlike complete physical renunciation which is suitable only for a few, this path of detached action is accessible to all, regardless of their station in life. It reconciles the apparent contradiction between action and renunciation by showing that true renunciation is internal—a renunciation of ego, attachment, and desire—rather than external abandonment of duties. This verse thus establishes the foundation for the subsequent verses that will elaborate on the nature of action, knowledge, and devotion in the final chapter of the Gita.",
