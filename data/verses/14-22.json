  "sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच\nप्रकाशं च प्रवृत्तिं च मोहमेव च पाण्डव।\nन द्वेष्टि सम्प्रवृत्तानि न निवृत्तानि काङ्क्षति॥",
  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nprakāśaṁ ca pravṛttiṁ ca moham eva ca pāṇḍava |\nna dveṣṭi sampravṛttāni na nivṛttāni kāṅkṣati ||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: O Pandava, he who does not hate illumination (sattva), activity (rajas), and delusion (tamas) when they are present, nor longs for them when they are absent.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins to answer Arjuna's question from verse 21 about the characteristics of one who has transcended the three gunas. The first quality of such a liberated soul is complete equanimity toward the manifestations of the three gunas. Prakasha (illumination) is the effect of sattva guna, pravritti (activity and restlessness) is the effect of rajas, and moha (delusion and inertia) is the effect of tamas. The transcendent person neither hates these qualities when they arise in his experience nor desires them when they subside.\n\nThis attitude represents a profound state of spiritual maturity where one has risen above the dualities created by the gunas. Such a person understands that these qualities are merely modifications of prakriti (material nature) and do not affect the true Self. He remains established in his essential nature as pure consciousness, witnessing the play of the gunas without identification. This non-reactive stance is not mere indifference or suppression, but rather a state of wisdom-born detachment where one recognizes the temporary and superficial nature of all guna-based experiences while remaining anchored in the eternal Self.",
