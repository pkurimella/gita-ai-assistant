  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: O Partha (Arjuna), when one completely renounces all desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self alone, then one is said to be established in wisdom.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a pivotal moment in the Bhagavad Gita, as Arjuna asks Krishna to describe the characteristics of one who is established in transcendental consciousness (sthita-prajna). Krishna's response begins here, outlining the first and most fundamental quality: complete freedom from material desires and self-satisfaction in the atman (Self). The phrase 'manogatān' (born of the mind) indicates that such desires originate from mental conditioning and identification with the body-mind complex rather than from the true Self.\n\nThe key teaching here is that the sthita-prajna finds complete contentment within, being satisfied 'by the Self in the Self' (ātmany evātmanā tuṣṭaḥ). This is not mere suppression of desires but a natural state where one's consciousness is so absorbed in the bliss of the Self that external objects lose their power to attract or disturb. This verse establishes the foundation for understanding spiritual realization as a state of inner fulfillment rather than external acquisition.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 2, this verse begins a series of descriptions (verses 55-72) that paint a complete picture of the enlightened sage. These characteristics serve as both a goal for spiritual aspirants and a practical guide for self-assessment on the spiritual path. The emphasis on renunciation of desires connects to the earlier teaching about transcending the pairs of opposites and remaining equipoised in all circumstances.",
