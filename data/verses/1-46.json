  "sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच\nएवमुक्त्वार्जुनः सङ्ख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत्।\nविसृज्य सशरं चापं शोकसंविग्नमानसः॥",
  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\nevam uktvārjunaḥ saṅkhye rathopastha upāviśat |\nvisṛjya saśaraṁ cāpaṁ śoka-saṁvigna-mānasaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus on the battlefield, Arjuna cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot seat, his mind overwhelmed with grief.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the conclusion of the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Sanjaya, who has been narrating the events to the blind king Dhritarashtra, describes Arjuna's complete emotional and physical collapse. The mighty warrior, who moments before stood ready for battle, now abandons his weapons and sinks into his chariot seat, paralyzed by sorrow and moral confusion. The image of Arjuna casting aside his bow (cāpa) and arrows (śara) is highly symbolic—it represents not just a physical act but a complete renunciation of his warrior duty (kshatriya-dharma) in that moment.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for the entire Bhagavad Gita's teachings. Arjuna's crisis is not merely emotional but deeply philosophical and ethical. He is torn between his duty as a warrior and his compassion for his kinsmen. His grief-stricken mind (śoka-saṁvigna-mānasaḥ) represents the human condition when faced with seemingly impossible moral dilemmas. This state of confusion and despair becomes the catalyst for Krishna's discourse, which will address not only Arjuna's immediate crisis but also the fundamental questions of human existence, duty, action, and liberation. The first chapter thus ends with a question mark, creating the perfect opening for the spiritual wisdom that follows in the subsequent chapters.",
