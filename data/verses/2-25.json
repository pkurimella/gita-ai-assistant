  "translation": "This Self is said to be unmanifest, unthinkable, and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing this to be such, you should not grieve.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his instruction on the nature of the eternal Self (Ātman) by describing three fundamental characteristics. The Self is avyakta (unmanifest) - it cannot be perceived by the senses; acintya (unthinkable) - it is beyond the grasp of the ordinary mind and intellectual speculation; and avikārya (unchangeable) - it undergoes no modification or transformation. These attributes emphasize the transcendental nature of the Self, which exists beyond the realm of material perception and mental conception.\n\nKrishna concludes this series of arguments about the immortality of the soul by urging Arjuna not to grieve. Having presented the Self as eternal, indestructible, and beyond all material changes, Krishna establishes that there is no rational basis for lamentation. Whether considering the eternal nature of the soul or the inevitable cycle of birth and death for the body, grief is inappropriate for one who understands this wisdom. This verse serves as a logical conclusion to the philosophical exposition that began in verse 2.11, where Krishna chided Arjuna for grieving over that which deserves no grief. The teaching emphasizes that true knowledge of the Self's nature liberates one from sorrow and delusion, preparing Arjuna (and all seekers) to perform their duties with equanimity and wisdom.",
