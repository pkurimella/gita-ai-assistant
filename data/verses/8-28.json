  "sanskrit": "वेदेषु यज्ञेषु तपःसु चैव दानेषु यत्पुण्यफलं प्रदिष्टम्।\nअत्येति तत्सर्वमिदं विदित्वा योगी परं स्थानमुपैति चाद्यम्॥",
  "transliteration": "vedeṣu yajñeṣu tapaḥsu caiva dāneṣu yat puṇya-phalaṁ pradiṣṭam |\natyeti tat sarvam idaṁ viditvā yogī paraṁ sthānam upaiti cādyam ||",
  "translation": "The yogi who knows this transcends all the meritorious results prescribed for the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charitable gifts, and attains the supreme primordial abode.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 8 summarizes the supreme benefit of understanding the teachings presented throughout the chapter. Krishna declares that the yogi who comprehends the knowledge about the imperishable Brahman, the paths of light and darkness, and the methods of reaching the Supreme transcends all the limited fruits that come from traditional religious practices. While studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices (yajñas), practicing austerities (tapas), and giving charity (dāna) all yield meritorious results, the knowledge and practice of yoga described in this chapter surpasses them all.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this transcendent knowledge leads the practitioner to the 'paraṁ sthānam' (supreme abode) which is also described as 'ādyam' (primordial or original). This refers to the eternal, unchanging reality of Brahman from which everything emanates and to which the liberated soul returns. Unlike the temporary heavenly rewards gained through ritualistic practices, this supreme destination is permanent and represents complete liberation (moksha). Krishna thus concludes the chapter by highlighting that the path of yoga and divine knowledge he has described is the ultimate means to reach the highest spiritual goal, transcending all conventional religious merit and leading to the eternal, primordial source itself.",
