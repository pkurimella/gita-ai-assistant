  "transliteration": "tad-buddhayaḥ tad-ātmānaḥ tan-niṣṭhāḥ tat-parāyaṇāḥ |\ngacchanty apunar-āvṛttiṁ jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those whose intellect is absorbed in That, whose self is established in That, whose steadfastness is in That, whose supreme goal is That—they go to the state of no return, their impurities washed away by knowledge.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics and ultimate destination of those who have attained complete absorption in the Supreme Reality. The fourfold repetition of 'tat' (That) emphasizes total integration at every level of being—intellect (buddhi), self-identity (ātman), unwavering commitment (niṣṭhā), and ultimate goal (parāyaṇa). Such individuals have achieved complete unity with Brahman, where every aspect of their consciousness is oriented toward and merged with the Divine.\n\nThe phrase 'jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ' indicates that true knowledge acts as a purifying force, washing away all impurities (kalmaṣa) accumulated through ignorance and past actions. This knowledge is not merely intellectual understanding but transformative wisdom that removes the very roots of bondage. When such purification is complete, the soul attains 'apunar-āvṛtti'—the state of no return—meaning liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nIn the context of Chapter 5, which discusses karma-sannyāsa (renunciation of action), this verse represents the culmination of the spiritual path. It shows that whether one follows the path of action or renunciation, the ultimate goal is the same: complete absorption in the Supreme Reality through purifying knowledge. This verse bridges the discussion of different yogic paths by pointing to their common destination—the transcendental state beyond all duality and suffering.",
