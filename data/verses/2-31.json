  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna shifts from the universal philosophical argument about the immortality of the soul to a more specific appeal based on Arjuna's personal duty (svadharma) as a Kshatriya warrior. Having established the eternal nature of the Self in previous verses, Krishna now addresses Arjuna's social and moral obligations. He emphasizes that for a warrior class member, fighting a righteous battle is not merely permissible but is the highest duty.\n\nThe concept of svadharma is central to this verse—it refers to one's own inherent duty based on one's nature, capacity, and position in society. Krishna argues that Arjuna should not hesitate or waver because this battle is dharmya (righteous), being fought to uphold justice and restore moral order. For a Kshatriya, whose very purpose is to protect dharma and fight against adharma, there exists no higher calling than engaging in such a just war.\n\nThis verse marks an important transition in Krishna's teaching strategy. He moves from abstract metaphysical truths to practical ethical considerations, showing how spiritual wisdom must be applied within one's specific life circumstances. The verse establishes that spiritual understanding does not mean abandoning one's worldly duties, but rather performing them with proper understanding and without attachment to results.",
