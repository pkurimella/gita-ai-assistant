  "translation": "But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct and separate kinds as different from one another—know that knowledge to be born of rajas (passion).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his analysis of the three types of knowledge according to the gunas, now describing rajasic knowledge. While sattvic knowledge perceives the one undivided eternal reality in all beings (as described in the previous verse), rajasic knowledge sees multiplicity and division everywhere. This type of knowledge recognizes differences and distinctions as ultimate reality, perceiving each being as fundamentally separate from others.\n\nRajasic knowledge is characterized by fragmentation and diversity without recognizing the underlying unity. It focuses on the external differences between beings—their forms, qualities, species, and characteristics—while missing the essential oneness that pervades all existence. This perspective leads to attachment, competition, and a sense of separateness that binds one to the material world. While such knowledge has practical utility in the empirical world, it is limited because it does not penetrate to the deeper spiritual truth of unity in diversity.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the Gita's epistemological framework. Krishna is teaching that the quality of our knowledge determines our spiritual progress. Rajasic knowledge, though not as deluded as tamasic knowledge, still keeps one bound to dualistic perception and prevents the realization of the supreme truth. It represents the intermediate stage where one has intellectual capacity but lacks the spiritual insight to perceive the fundamental oneness of all existence.",
