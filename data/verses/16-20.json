  "translation": "Entering into demoniac wombs, birth after birth, these deluded souls, O son of Kunti, without ever reaching Me, sink into the lowest state of existence.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the tragic trajectory of those who persist in demoniac qualities. The phrase 'āsurīṁ yonim āpannāḥ' indicates that those who cultivate demoniac traits are reborn repeatedly in circumstances that reinforce these negative tendencies. The term 'mūḍhāḥ' (deluded) emphasizes that such beings are trapped in ignorance, unable to recognize the path to liberation. Birth after birth, they accumulate more negative karma, creating a downward spiral.\n\nThe verse highlights the principle of karmic momentum - those who consistently choose the path of ego, desire, and ignorance create patterns that perpetuate themselves across lifetimes. 'Mām aprāpya' (without reaching Me) indicates that such souls move further away from the Divine rather than closer to it. This is not divine punishment but the natural consequence of one's choices and the cultivation of certain qualities.\n\nThe phrase 'adhamāṁ gatim' (lowest state) refers to increasingly degraded forms of existence, possibly including sub-human births. This verse serves as a stark warning about the consequences of persisting in demoniac qualities, while also emphasizing the importance of cultivating divine qualities (daivī sampad) discussed earlier in the chapter. It underscores the urgency of spiritual practice and the need to consciously choose the path of dharma.",
