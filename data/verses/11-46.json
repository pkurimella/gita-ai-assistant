  "sanskrit": "किरीटिनं गदिनं चक्रहस्तमिच्छामि त्वां द्रष्टुमहं तथैव ।\nतेनैव रूपेण चतुर्भुजेन सहस्रबाहो भव विश्वमूर्ते ॥",
  "transliteration": "kirīṭinaṁ gadinaṁ cakra-hastam icchāmi tvāṁ draṣṭum ahaṁ tathaiva |\ntenaiva rūpeṇa catur-bhujena sahasra-bāho bhava viśva-mūrte ||",
  "translation": "I wish to see You as before, crowned with a diadem, holding a mace and discus in Your hand. O thousand-armed one, O Universal Form, please assume again that four-armed form.",
  "commentary": "After witnessing the overwhelming and terrifying cosmic form of the Lord, Arjuna requests Krishna to return to His more familiar and gentle four-armed Vishnu form. The vision of the universal form, with its countless arms, mouths, and eyes consuming all beings, has left Arjuna deeply disturbed and frightened. He longs for the reassuring sight of the Lord in His benign aspect, adorned with crown (kirīṭa), wielding the mace (gadā) and discus (cakra) - the traditional attributes of Lord Vishnu.\n\nThis verse reveals an important aspect of devotion and divine revelation. While the cosmic form represents the ultimate truth of God's all-encompassing nature, it is too overwhelming for the human mind to bear for long. Arjuna's request demonstrates that devotees naturally seek a personal, approachable form of the Divine with which they can establish an intimate relationship. The four-armed form represents a middle ground between the completely human two-armed form of Krishna and the infinite cosmic form - it is divine yet comprehensible, majestic yet accessible.\n\nThe verse also highlights the principle that God manifests in forms suitable to the capacity and need of the devotee. Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'sahasra-bāho' (thousand-armed) and 'viśva-mūrte' (Universal Form) even while requesting the four-armed form, acknowledging that all forms are manifestations of the same Supreme Reality. This represents the devotional understanding that the personal form and the cosmic form are not contradictory but complementary aspects of the one Divine Being.",
