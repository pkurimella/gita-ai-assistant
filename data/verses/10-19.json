  "sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nहन्त ते कथयिष्यामि दिव्या ह्यात्मविभूतयः |\nप्राधान्यतः कुरुश्रेष्ठ नास्त्यन्तो विस्तरस्य मे ||",
  "transliteration": "śrī bhagavān uvāca |\nhanta te kathayiṣyāmi divyā hy ātma-vibhūtayaḥ |\nprādhānyataḥ kuru-śreṣṭha nāsty anto vistarasya me ||",
  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My divine manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O best of the Kurus, for there is no end to My infinite glories.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna responds to Arjuna's request in the previous verse to hear more about the divine manifestations (vibhūtis). Krishna agrees to describe His glories but with an important qualification—He will speak only of the principal ones (prādhānyataḥ), as His manifestations are endless and infinite. This acknowledgment of infinity is crucial to understanding the nature of the Divine.\n\nKrishna addresses Arjuna as 'Kuru-śreṣṭha' (best of the Kurus), showing affection and respect while preparing to reveal profound spiritual truths. The Lord emphasizes that His divine manifestations are without limit (nāsty anto vistarasya me), indicating that the Supreme Reality pervades all of creation in countless ways. This verse sets the stage for the enumeration of vibhūtis that follows in subsequent verses.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that while God is both immanent and transcendent, any description of His manifestations must necessarily be selective. The infinite cannot be fully captured in finite words, yet through prominent examples, the devotee can develop the vision to recognize the Divine presence everywhere. This approach helps the spiritual aspirant cultivate awareness of the sacred in all aspects of existence.",
