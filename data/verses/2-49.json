  "transliteration": "dūreṇa hy avaraṁ karma buddhi-yogād dhanañjaya |\nbuddhau śaraṇam anviccha kṛpaṇāḥ phala-hetavaḥ ||",
  "translation": "Action with desire for results is far inferior to the yoga of wisdom, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna). Seek refuge in the wisdom of equanimity. Pitiable are those who are motivated by the fruits of action.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a clear hierarchy between karma performed with desire for results and karma yoga performed with buddhi (discriminative wisdom). He declares that ordinary action driven by desire for fruits is vastly inferior (dūreṇa hy avaram) to buddhi-yoga, the yoga of equanimous wisdom. This buddhi-yoga refers to performing one's duties with skill and balance, without attachment to outcomes, which Krishna has been explaining as the essence of karma yoga.\n\nKrishna advises Arjuna to take refuge (śaraṇam) in buddhi—the higher discriminative intelligence that maintains equanimity in success and failure. This buddhi is not mere intellectual knowledge but a state of inner balance and wisdom that guides action. The verse then delivers a strong critique of those who act solely for results, calling them 'kṛpaṇāḥ' (pitiable or miserly). These individuals are enslaved by their desires and remain bound to the cycle of action and reaction, unable to experience the freedom that comes from selfless action.\n\nThis verse is pivotal in Chapter 2 as it transitions from the theoretical exposition of Sāṅkhya philosophy to the practical application of karma yoga. It emphasizes that the quality of one's consciousness while acting is more important than the action itself. Those who act with wisdom and equanimity transcend bondage, while those motivated purely by results remain trapped in suffering, regardless of whether they achieve their desired outcomes or not.",
