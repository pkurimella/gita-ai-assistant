  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his strategic argument to motivate Arjuna to fight by appealing to his sense of honor and reputation. After explaining the spiritual principles of the immortal soul and the warrior's duty, Krishna now addresses the practical social consequences of Arjuna's potential withdrawal from battle. He warns that if Arjuna refuses to fight, people will speak of his disgrace forever (avyayām - imperishable, eternal). This dishonor will not fade with time but will become a permanent stain on his reputation.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that for a person who has been highly respected and honored (sambhāvitasya), such as Arjuna who is renowned as a great warrior and hero, dishonor is a fate worse than death itself. This argument is particularly powerful in the context of ancient Indian society where honor, especially for a Kshatriya (warrior), was considered more valuable than life itself. The verse appeals to Arjuna's pride and social standing, complementing the earlier spiritual and philosophical arguments.\n\nThis verse demonstrates Krishna's comprehensive approach to counseling Arjuna - he addresses not only the highest spiritual truths but also the practical worldly concerns. Krishna understands that Arjuna, despite his spiritual confusion, is still deeply embedded in his social role and reputation. By showing that withdrawal from battle would result in eternal disgrace, Krishna removes any notion that refusing to fight might be the easier or more comfortable path. The verse serves as a bridge between the transcendental wisdom of the earlier verses and the practical dharmic duty that Arjuna must fulfill.",
