  "commentary": "This verse describes foods preferred by those dominated by rajas (the mode of passion). Krishna enumerates seven qualities that characterize rajasic foods: bitter (kaṭu), sour (amla), salty (lavaṇa), excessively hot (aty-uṣṇa), pungent (tīkṣṇa), dry (rūkṣa), and burning (vidāhina). These foods overstimulate the senses and create agitation in both body and mind. Unlike sattvic foods which promote health and longevity, rajasic foods provide immediate sensory gratification but lead to negative consequences.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that such foods are 'dear' (iṣṭa) to rajasic individuals, indicating that food preferences reflect one's inner nature and guṇa composition. The threefold result of consuming such foods—duḥkha (physical distress), śoka (mental grief or sorrow), and āmaya (disease)—demonstrates how dietary choices affect physical health, emotional well-being, and mental peace. This teaching aligns with the chapter's broader theme that faith and spiritual quality manifest in all aspects of life, including eating habits. The verse serves as practical guidance for spiritual aspirants to recognize and modify their dietary patterns as part of their sādhana, understanding that what we consume directly influences our consciousness and spiritual progress.",
