  "transliteration": "bhaktyā tv ananyayā śakya aham evaṁ-vidho 'rjuna |\njñātuṁ draṣṭuṁ ca tattvena praveṣṭuṁ ca parantapa ||54||",
  "translation": "But by single-minded devotion alone, O Arjuna, can I be known in this form, seen in truth, and entered into, O scorcher of foes.",
  "commentary": "In this crucial verse, Krishna reveals the supreme means to realize Him in His true nature. After showing Arjuna the terrifying cosmic form and then returning to His gentle four-armed and two-armed forms, Krishna now declares that ananya-bhakti (exclusive, undivided devotion) is the only path to truly know, see, and unite with the Divine. This verse emphasizes three progressive stages: jñātum (to know intellectually), draṣṭum (to perceive directly), and praveṣṭum (to enter into or become one with). Neither Vedic study, austerities, charity, nor rituals mentioned in the previous verse can accomplish what pure devotion can.\n\nThe term 'ananyayā bhaktyā' (by undivided devotion) is particularly significant. It means devotion that sees nothing else but the Lord, devotion that is not mixed with desires for worldly gains or even liberation. This verse establishes bhakti as the supreme means (sādhana) for God-realization, transcending even knowledge and action. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'parantapa' (scorcher of foes), reminding him that the same focused intensity needed to defeat enemies in battle must be applied to devotion. This verse is often cited as the essence of bhakti-yoga and demonstrates that the ultimate reality, though cosmic and incomprehensible, becomes accessible through the simple path of loving devotion.",
