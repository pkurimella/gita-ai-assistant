  "sanskrit": "यत्साङ्ख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते ।\nएकं साङ्ख्यं च योगं च यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥५॥",
  "transliteration": "yat sāṅkhyaiḥ prāpyate sthānaṁ tad yogair api gamyate |\nekaṁ sāṅkhyaṁ ca yogaṁ ca yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati ||5||",
  "translation": "The state that is reached by the followers of Sankhya (path of knowledge) is also attained by the followers of Yoga (path of action). One who sees Sankhya and Yoga as one, truly sees.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna resolves the apparent dichotomy between the path of knowledge (Jnana Yoga or Sankhya) and the path of action (Karma Yoga). He declares that both paths lead to the same ultimate destination - liberation or self-realization. The verse emphasizes that these are not contradictory or competing paths, but complementary approaches to the same goal. The person of true wisdom recognizes their essential unity and does not get caught in sectarian divisions or philosophical disputes about which path is superior.\n\nThe key insight here is that renunciation of action (sannyasa) and performance of action in a spirit of yoga both purify the mind and lead to the same spiritual realization. Sankhya represents the analytical discrimination between the Self and non-Self, leading to knowledge, while Yoga represents disciplined action performed without attachment to results. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that he need not abandon his duties as a warrior to attain spiritual liberation; rather, he can achieve the same goal through dedicated, selfless action. This verse serves as a foundational principle for the entire chapter, establishing that true renunciation is internal rather than merely external abandonment of activities.",
