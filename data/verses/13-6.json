  "transliteration": "mahābhūtāny ahaṅkāro buddhir avyaktam eva ca |\nindriyāṇi daśaikaṃ ca pañca cendriya-gocarāḥ ||",
  "translation": "The five great elements, egoism, intellect, the unmanifest, the ten senses and the one (mind), and the five objects of the senses.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins enumerating the twenty-four components that constitute the kṣetra (field). The five great elements (mahābhūtas) are earth, water, fire, air, and ether—the fundamental building blocks of material existence. Ahaṅkāra (ego or I-sense) is the principle of individuation that creates the sense of separate identity. Buddhi (intellect) is the discriminative faculty of consciousness. Avyakta (the unmanifest) refers to prakṛti in its primordial, undifferentiated state, the root cause of all material manifestation.\n\nThe ten senses (indriyāṇi daśa) comprise the five organs of perception (jñānendriyās: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin) and the five organs of action (karmendriyās: hands, feet, speech, organs of excretion and reproduction). The 'one' (ekam) refers to manas (mind), which coordinates sensory input and motor output. The five objects of the senses (pañca indriya-gocarāḥ) are sound, touch, form, taste, and smell—the tanmātras or subtle elements that are the objects of sensory experience. This systematic enumeration follows the Sāṅkhya philosophy's analysis of material nature, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding what constitutes the field of experience as distinct from the conscious knower who witnesses it.",
