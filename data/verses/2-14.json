  "translation": "O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and their objects gives rise to sensations of cold and heat, pleasure and pain. These are temporary, with a beginning and an end. Therefore, O descendant of Bharata, learn to endure them.",
  "commentary": "In this foundational verse, Krishna addresses Arjuna's emotional turmoil by introducing the concept of sensory perception and its temporary nature. The term 'mātrā-sparśa' refers to the contact between sense organs and sense objects, which creates all our experiences of duality—heat and cold, pleasure and pain. Krishna emphasizes that these experiences are 'anityāḥ' (impermanent), constantly coming and going like waves on the ocean.\n\nThe instruction to 'titikṣasva' (endure or forbear) is crucial to spiritual practice. Krishna is not asking Arjuna to become insensitive or suppress his feelings, but rather to develop the wisdom to recognize that sensory experiences are fleeting and should not determine one's actions or sense of duty. This verse establishes an important principle in Vedantic philosophy: the distinction between the eternal Self and the temporary experiences of the body-mind complex.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant to Arjuna's situation on the battlefield, where he is overwhelmed by grief and attachment. By understanding that his emotional responses are products of sensory contact and are therefore temporary, Arjuna can rise above his immediate feelings and act according to his dharma. This verse lays the groundwork for the deeper teachings on equanimity (samatva) and steadiness of mind (sthita-prajña) that follow in this chapter.",
