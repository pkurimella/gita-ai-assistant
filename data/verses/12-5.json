  "translation": "Greater is the difficulty for those whose minds are attached to the Unmanifest, for the path to the Unmanifest is very hard for the embodied to reach.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains why the path of devotion to the Personal God (saguna bhakti) is superior to the path of meditation on the formless Absolute (nirguna upasana) for most spiritual aspirants. He states that those who fix their consciousness on the Unmanifest (avyakta) face greater hardship and struggle (klesha). The reason is that as long as one is embodied and identified with the physical form, it is extremely difficult to comprehend and realize that which is beyond all form, attributes, and sensory perception.\n\nThis verse provides practical guidance for spiritual seekers. While the Unmanifest Brahman and the Manifest Divine are ultimately one reality, the approach through form, qualities, and personal relationship is more natural and accessible for embodied beings. The path of the Unmanifest requires tremendous intellectual capacity, extreme detachment, and the ability to transcend body-consciousness completely—qualities that are rare and difficult to develop. Krishna is not dismissing the validity of the formless path, but rather acknowledging the psychological and practical challenges it presents to those still strongly identified with their physical existence. This sets the stage for Krishna's subsequent verses where he will elaborate on the more accessible path of devotional yoga.",
