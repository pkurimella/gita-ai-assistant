  "transliteration": "yatanto yoginaś cainaṁ paśyanty ātmany avasthitam |\nyatanto 'py akṛtātmāno nainaṁ paśyanty acetasaḥ ||",
  "translation": "The yogis who strive earnestly perceive Him dwelling within themselves. But those whose minds are unpurified and who lack understanding do not perceive Him, even though they may strive.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes a crucial distinction between two types of spiritual aspirants. Krishna explains that self-realized yogis who have purified their consciousness through disciplined practice can directly perceive the Supreme Self (Paramātman) residing within their own being. These practitioners have developed the inner vision necessary to recognize the divine presence that pervades all existence, as described in the previous verses about the Lord entering and sustaining all beings.\n\nHowever, Krishna also acknowledges that mere effort alone is insufficient without proper preparation. Those who are 'akṛtātmānaḥ' (unprepared souls) and 'acetasaḥ' (lacking discriminative intelligence) cannot perceive this inner reality despite their attempts. This emphasizes the importance of both ethical purification and intellectual refinement in spiritual practice. The verse suggests that spiritual realization requires not just effort, but the right kind of effort—one that includes moral discipline, mental purification, and the cultivation of discriminative wisdom. This teaching fits within Chapter 15's broader theme of understanding the Supreme Person who transcends yet pervades all manifestation.",
