  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation",
  "sanskrit": "अनिष्टमिष्टं मिश्रं च त्रिविधं कर्मणः फलम्।\nभवत्यत्यागिनां प्रेत्य न तु संन्यासिनां क्वचित्॥",
  "transliteration": "aniṣṭam iṣṭaṁ miśraṁ ca tri-vidhaṁ karmaṇaḥ phalam|\nbhavaty atyāgināṁ pretya na tu saṁnyāsināṁ kvacit||",
  "translation": "The threefold fruits of action—undesirable, desirable, and mixed—accrue after death to those who have not renounced, but never to those who have renounced.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains the consequences of attachment to the fruits of action. He describes three types of karmic results: iṣṭa (desirable/pleasant), aniṣṭa (undesirable/unpleasant), and miśra (mixed). Those who perform actions with attachment to results (atyāginām—non-renouncers) continue to accumulate these karmic fruits that bind them to the cycle of birth and death. After death, they must experience the consequences of their actions in future births.\n\nIn contrast, those who have truly renounced (saṁnyāsinām) the fruits of action while performing their duties do not accumulate any karmic bondage. This renunciation is not physical abandonment of action, but rather the internal renunciation of desire for results. Such individuals perform actions as offerings to the Divine, without personal attachment, and therefore remain free from karmic consequences. This verse reinforces the central teaching of the Gita: perform your duty without attachment to results.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in Chapter 18 as Krishna synthesizes the entire message of the Gita. The distinction between those who renounce fruits (true renunciates) and those who remain attached highlights the practical path to liberation—karma yoga combined with jñāna (knowledge). The verse emphasizes that liberation is not about escaping action, but about transforming one's relationship with action through detachment and surrender.",
