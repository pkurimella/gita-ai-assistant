  "translation": "These bodies of the eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable embodied soul are said to have an end. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a fundamental distinction between the perishable physical body and the imperishable soul (ātman). He declares that while the physical bodies are finite and subject to destruction (antavanta), the soul that dwells within is eternal (nitya), indestructible (anāśina), and immeasurable (aprameya). This teaching forms the cornerstone of the Sānkhya philosophy presented in this chapter, which distinguishes between matter (prakṛti) and spirit (puruṣa).\n\nKrishna uses this philosophical foundation to address Arjuna's moral dilemma about fighting in the war. Since the true self cannot be killed and the body is temporary anyway, Arjuna need not grieve over the inevitable death of bodies in battle. The soul transcends physical destruction, making the apparent violence of war less absolute than it appears. This verse directly follows the previous verses where Krishna explained that the soul cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried—it is eternal and unchanging.\n\nThe practical application comes in the final instruction 'tasmād yudhyasva' (therefore fight). Krishna is not promoting violence for its own sake, but rather teaching Arjuna to act according to his dharma (duty as a warrior) without being paralyzed by attachment to temporary physical forms. This verse encapsulates the Gita's teaching of performing one's duty while maintaining spiritual wisdom about the true nature of reality—a balance between metaphysical knowledge and practical action in the world.",
