  "sanskrit": "अश्रद्धया हुतं दत्तं तपस्तप्तं कृतं च यत् ।\nअसदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य नो इह ॥",
  "transliteration": "aśraddhayā hutaṁ dattaṁ tapas taptaṁ kṛtaṁ ca yat |\nasad ity ucyate pārtha na ca tat pretya no iha ||",
  "translation": "Whatever is sacrificed, given, or performed, and whatever austerity is practiced without faith—it is called 'asat' (unreal), O Partha. It is of no value here or hereafter.",
  "commentary": "This verse concludes Chapter 17 by emphasizing the absolute necessity of faith (shraddha) in all spiritual practices. Krishna declares that any sacrifice, charity, austerity, or religious action performed without genuine faith is termed 'asat'—meaning unreal, impermanent, or without true substance. This stands in contrast to 'sat' (real, eternal truth) which has been discussed in the previous verses. The absence of faith renders even seemingly pious actions spiritually ineffective and fruitless.\n\nThe verse underscores that faith is not merely an optional element but the very foundation that gives meaning and efficacy to spiritual practices. Without shraddha, rituals become mechanical, charity becomes mere transaction, and austerities become empty self-torture. Krishna emphasizes that such faithless actions bear no fruit either in this world ('iha') or in the hereafter ('pretya'), making them completely worthless from a spiritual standpoint. This teaching reinforces the chapter's central theme that the quality of faith determines the quality and outcome of all actions, and that true spiritual progress requires sincere devotion and belief in the divine principles underlying one's practices.",
