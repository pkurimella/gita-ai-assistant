  "commentary": "This verse presents the culminating teaching on karma yoga combined with devotion. Krishna assures that one who performs all duties while completely surrendered to the Divine (mad-vyapāśrayaḥ) will attain the supreme goal through divine grace (mat-prasāda). The emphasis is on the combination of action (sarva-karmāṇi kurvāṇaḥ) with complete dependence on God, rather than renunciation of action itself.\n\nThe verse highlights the path of bhakti-yoga integrated with karma-yoga. Even while engaged in all worldly activities, the devotee who has taken complete shelter in Krishna transcends the binding effects of karma. The 'eternal, imperishable state' (śāśvataṃ padam avyayam) refers to moksha or liberation, which is attained not merely through one's own efforts but through divine grace that flows from sincere surrender and devotion.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18, which synthesizes all the paths discussed throughout the Gita. It demonstrates that liberation is accessible even to those engaged in worldly duties, provided they maintain the right consciousness of surrender and devotion. The verse reassures practitioners that divine grace is the ultimate factor in spiritual attainment, complementing and perfecting human effort.",
