  "translation": "Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet establishing Myself in My own nature, I come into being through My own divine power (Maya).",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna reveals the paradox of divine incarnation. Though He is unborn (aja), imperishable (avyaya), and the Supreme Lord (Īśvara) of all beings, He still takes birth in the material world. This apparent contradiction is resolved through the concept of Ātma-māyā—His own divine creative power. Unlike ordinary beings who are compelled to take birth due to karma, Krishna's birth is voluntary and purposeful, accomplished through His own will and divine energy.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that Krishna's incarnation does not involve any change in His essential nature. He remains transcendent while simultaneously manifesting in the phenomenal world. By 'establishing Himself in His own nature' (prakṛtiṁ svām adhiṣṭhāya), He uses His own divine Prakṛti or energy, not the material nature that binds ordinary souls. This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of divine avatāras—they are not subject to material conditioning but appear out of compassion to restore dharma and guide humanity, as will be explained in the following verses.",
