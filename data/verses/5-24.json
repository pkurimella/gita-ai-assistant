  "sanskrit": "योऽन्तःसुखोऽन्तरारामस्तथान्तर्ज्योतिरेव यः ।\nस योगी ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं ब्रह्मभूतोऽधिगच्छति ॥२४॥",
  "transliteration": "yo'ntaḥ-sukho'ntar-ārāmas tathāntar-jyotir eva yaḥ |\nsa yogī brahma-nirvāṇaṁ brahma-bhūto'dhigacchati ||24||",
  "translation": "One who finds happiness within, who rejoices within, and who is illumined within—that yogi, becoming one with Brahman, attains liberation in Brahman (Brahma-nirvana).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of a self-realized yogi who has transcended external dependencies for happiness and fulfillment. Such a person finds complete satisfaction (antaḥ-sukha) within their own Self, delights (antar-ārama) in the inner reality, and experiences the inner light (antar-jyoti) of consciousness. These three qualities—inner happiness, inner delight, and inner illumination—indicate a complete turning inward of consciousness away from sensory objects and toward the eternal Self.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this internalized state is not merely psychological contentment but represents the actual realization of one's identity with Brahman (brahma-bhūta). When a yogi achieves this state of inner absorption and self-sufficiency, they naturally attain brahma-nirvāṇa—complete liberation or extinction of all limiting identifications in the infinite reality of Brahman. This is the culmination of the path of Karma Yoga described in this chapter, where action performed without attachment leads to inner purification and ultimately to Self-realization. The verse connects directly to the chapter's theme by showing that true renunciation is not merely external but is the inner state of one who has discovered the fullness of existence within their own being.",
