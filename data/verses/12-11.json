  "translation": "If you are unable to do even this practice while taking refuge in My yoga, then, with self-control, renounce the fruits of all actions.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents yet another alternative for those who find the previous practices too difficult. This represents the fourth step in the hierarchy of spiritual practices outlined in this chapter. If one cannot engage in constant remembrance or dedicated spiritual practices, Krishna advises the renunciation of the fruits of all actions (sarva-karma-phala-tyāga). This is the practice of nishkama karma—performing one's duties without attachment to results.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant as it makes spiritual progress accessible to everyone, regardless of their current capacity. By performing actions without desire for personal gain and offering the results to the Divine, one gradually purifies the mind and develops the capacity for higher practices. The term 'yatātmavān' (self-controlled) indicates that even this practice requires discipline and conscious effort to remain detached from outcomes.\n\nThis verse demonstrates Krishna's compassionate pedagogy, providing a graduated path where each aspirant can find an entry point suited to their present abilities. The renunciation of fruits doesn't mean abandoning action, but rather transforming one's relationship with action—performing duties skillfully while remaining internally free from anxiety about results. This practice naturally leads to mental purification, which in turn enables the higher practices of devotion mentioned earlier in the chapter.",
