  "translation": "This same multitude of beings, coming into existence again and again, is dissolved helplessly at the coming of night, O Partha, and comes forth again at the coming of day.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the cyclical nature of manifest existence within the cosmic day and night of Brahma. The same multitude of beings (bhūta-grāmaḥ) repeatedly comes into manifestation and dissolves in an endless cycle. The term 'avaśaḥ' (helplessly or involuntarily) is particularly significant, indicating that ordinary beings bound by karma have no control over this process—they are compelled by their karmic impressions to take birth again and again.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the repetitive and mechanical nature of worldly existence for those who have not attained liberation. At the arrival of Brahma's night (cosmic dissolution), all beings in the manifest realm are absorbed back into the unmanifest state, only to emerge again when Brahma's day begins. This cosmic rhythm operates with inexorable regularity, and beings caught in the cycle of samsara are subject to it without choice. The verse serves to highlight the futility of seeking permanent satisfaction in the realm of constant change and dissolution, thereby motivating the seeker to transcend this cycle through spiritual knowledge and devotion, which Krishna will contrast with the imperishable reality in subsequent verses.",
