  "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: Behold, O Partha (Arjuna), My forms by the hundreds and thousands, of various kinds, divine, and of various colors and shapes.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks Krishna's response to Arjuna's request to see His cosmic form. Krishna begins to reveal the infinite nature of His divine manifestation, indicating that what Arjuna is about to witness transcends ordinary perception. The use of 'hundreds and thousands' (śataśaḥ sahasraśaḥ) emphasizes the unlimited and incomprehensible nature of the divine reality. Krishna describes these forms as 'divyāni' (divine), indicating they are celestial and beyond material comprehension, existing in various colors and shapes that represent the infinite diversity of creation.\n\nThis verse serves as a prelude to the actual vision of the Viśvarūpa (Universal Form) that follows. Krishna is preparing Arjuna's mind for the overwhelming experience ahead by describing the multiplicity and divine nature of what he will witness. The verse establishes that the Supreme Reality is not limited to any single form but encompasses all forms, colors, and manifestations. This teaching is central to understanding the relationship between the personal and impersonal aspects of divinity in Vedantic philosophy.\n\nThe significance of this verse lies in its revelation that the divine encompasses infinite diversity within unity. Krishna's use of 'paśya' (behold) is an invitation to direct perception rather than intellectual understanding alone. This experiential knowledge (aparokṣa-jñāna) represents a higher form of realization than mere scriptural learning, demonstrating the Gita's emphasis on direct spiritual experience as the ultimate means of understanding the divine nature.",
