  "transliteration": "mūḍha-grāheṇātmano yat pīḍayā kriyate tapaḥ |\nparasyotsādanārthaṃ vā tat tāmasam udāhṛtam ||19||",
  "translation": "Austerity performed with a foolish notion, involving self-torture, or for the purpose of destroying or injuring others—that is declared to be tamasic (born of ignorance).",
  "commentary": "This verse concludes Krishna's exposition on the three types of austerity (tapas) by describing tamasic austerity, which is the lowest and most harmful form. Such austerity is characterized by two main features: it is performed either with self-destructive intent through foolish understanding, or with the malicious purpose of harming others. The term 'mūḍha-grāheṇa' (foolish notion) indicates that the practitioner lacks proper understanding of the true purpose of austerity, which should be self-purification and spiritual growth, not self-torture or harm to others.\n\nTamasic austerity includes extreme practices undertaken without proper guidance or understanding, such as severe self-mortification that damages the body and mind, or occult practices performed with the intention of causing harm to enemies. This also encompasses rituals performed with hatred, jealousy, or the desire to destroy others' well-being. Such practices, though they may appear as austerity externally, are actually expressions of ignorance and delusion, and lead the practitioner further away from spiritual realization.\n\nIn the broader context of Chapter 17, this verse completes the analysis of how the three gunas (qualities of nature) manifest in various aspects of spiritual practice—faith, worship, food, sacrifice, charity, and austerity. Krishna emphasizes that true spiritual practice must be sattvic in nature, performed with proper understanding, without causing harm to oneself or others, and with the aim of self-purification and divine realization. Tamasic austerity, being rooted in ignorance and harmful intent, binds one to suffering and delusion rather than leading to liberation.",
