  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of the twelfth chapter, where Arjuna poses a fundamental question about two paths of spiritual practice. Having heard Krishna's teachings about both the personal form of the Divine (saguna brahman) and the formless Absolute (nirguna brahman) in previous chapters, Arjuna seeks clarification on which path is superior. He asks about those who worship Krishna's personal form with constant devotion (bhakti) versus those who meditate on the imperishable, unmanifest Reality beyond all attributes.\n\nThis question is significant because it addresses a perennial debate in Indian philosophy between the paths of bhakti (devotion to a personal God) and jnana (knowledge of the impersonal Absolute). Arjuna's inquiry reflects the practical concern of a spiritual aspirant trying to determine the most effective means to reach the ultimate goal. The chapter that follows will establish bhakti yoga as more accessible and natural for most practitioners, while acknowledging the validity of both approaches. This verse sets the stage for Krishna's detailed exposition on the characteristics of true devotees and the supremacy of loving devotion as a spiritual path.",
