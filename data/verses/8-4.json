  "translation": "The perishable nature is the Adhibhuta (the physical manifestation); the Purusha (Cosmic Being) is the Adhidaivata (the divine aspect); and I alone am the Adhiyajna (the Lord of sacrifice) here in this body, O best of the embodied beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues answering Arjuna's questions from the previous verses, specifically defining three important metaphysical principles. Adhibhuta refers to the ever-changing physical realm, the perishable material nature that undergoes constant transformation. Adhidaivata represents the presiding deities or the cosmic intelligence that governs various aspects of creation, identified here as Purusha, the Cosmic Person. Most significantly, Krishna reveals that He Himself is the Adhiyajna, the Supreme Lord who is the ultimate recipient and witness of all sacrifices performed in the body.\n\nThis verse is crucial in establishing the omnipresence of the Divine. By declaring Himself as Adhiyajna residing within the body, Krishna emphasizes that the Supreme is not distant or abstract, but intimately present within each individual. This indwelling presence makes every action, when performed with proper consciousness, a potential act of worship. The term 'deha-bhṛtām vara' (O best of embodied beings) is an affectionate address to Arjuna, acknowledging his sincere quest for knowledge.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding these three aspects as different dimensions of reality—the material (Adhibhuta), the cosmic-divine (Adhidaivata), and the transcendent-immanent Supreme (Adhiyajna). This framework helps the spiritual aspirant comprehend how the Divine pervades all levels of existence, from the gross physical to the subtle cosmic, and ultimately as the Supreme Witness within. This knowledge is essential for the practice of remembering the Divine at the time of death, which is the central theme of this chapter.",
