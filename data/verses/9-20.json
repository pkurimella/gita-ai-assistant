  "sanskrit": "त्रैविद्या मां सोमपाः पूतपापा यज्ञैरिष्ट्वा स्वर्गतिं प्रार्थयन्ते ।\nते पुण्यमासाद्य सुरेन्द्रलोकमश्नन्ति दिव्यान्दिवि देवभोगान् ॥२०॥",
  "transliteration": "traividyā māṁ somapāḥ pūta-pāpā yajñair iṣṭvā svargatiṁ prārthayante |\nte puṇyam āsādya surendra-lokam aśnanti divyān divi deva-bhogān ||20||",
  "translation": "Those who study the three Vedas, drink the soma juice, and are purified of sins, worship Me through sacrifices and pray for passage to heaven. Reaching the holy world of Indra as a result of their virtuous deeds, they enjoy the celestial pleasures of the gods in the heavenly regions.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the limited results obtained by those who follow the ritualistic path of the Vedas with material desires. The 'traividyā' refers to those who study the three Vedas (Rig, Yajur, and Sama) focusing primarily on the karma-kanda or ritualistic portions. These practitioners perform elaborate sacrifices, drink soma (a sacred ritual beverage), and become temporarily purified of sins. However, their worship is motivated by the desire for heavenly pleasures rather than liberation or pure devotion.\n\nKrishna explains that such worshippers do indeed attain their desired goal—they reach the celestial realm of Indra (surendra-loka) and enjoy divine pleasures. However, this achievement is temporary and limited. The verse sets up a contrast that Krishna will develop in the following verse, highlighting the difference between those who seek temporary material or heavenly rewards and those who seek eternal union with the Divine. This teaching is central to Chapter 9's theme of revealing the supreme secret: that exclusive devotion to Krishna leads to permanent liberation, while desire-motivated worship, even of the highest Vedic type, yields only temporary results. The verse serves as a critique of ritualism divorced from true knowledge and devotion, emphasizing that the ultimate goal should be transcendence rather than mere elevation to higher material planes.",
