  "translation": "The yogi who, established in oneness, worships Me as dwelling in all beings, whatever his mode of living, abides in Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the highest state of yogic realization where the practitioner perceives the Divine presence in all beings. The key concept here is 'ekatvam' (oneness) - the yogi who has established himself in the awareness that the same Supreme Self dwells in all creatures worships Krishna through this unified vision. This is not mere intellectual understanding but a lived reality where one sees the Divine equally present in every form of existence.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that such a yogi, regardless of external circumstances or activities ('sarvathā vartamāno 'pi' - whatever his mode of living), remains established in the Divine consciousness. This teaching liberates spiritual practice from being confined to specific rituals or locations. The yogi who has attained this vision of unity transcends the duality of sacred and mundane, seeing all actions as occurring within the Divine. This verse builds upon the previous teaching about seeing the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self, now adding the dimension of devotional worship (bhajati) to this non-dual awareness.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in the integration of jnana (knowledge), yoga (meditation), and bhakti (devotion). The yogi doesn't withdraw from the world but engages with it while maintaining constant awareness of the Divine presence everywhere. This represents the practical culmination of the meditation practices described throughout this chapter - not escape from life, but transformation of perception that allows one to live in the world while remaining anchored in transcendent consciousness.",
