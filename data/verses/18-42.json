  "commentary": "This verse describes the natural qualities and duties (svabhāva-ja karma) of the Brahmana varna. Krishna enumerates nine essential characteristics that define the Brahmana temperament. These include śama (mental tranquility), dama (control over the senses), tapas (austerity and discipline), śauca (internal and external purity), kṣānti (forbearance and forgiveness), ārjava (straightforwardness and honesty), jñāna (theoretical knowledge of scriptures), vijñāna (experiential wisdom and realization), and āstikya (faith in the Vedas and the Divine reality).\n\nIn the context of Chapter 18, this verse is part of Krishna's exposition on the four-fold division of society based on guṇas (qualities) and karma (duties). The Brahmana qualities are predominantly characterized by sattva guṇa—purity, wisdom, and spiritual inclination. These are not merely professional duties but natural expressions of one's inner constitution. When one performs duties aligned with their svabhāva (inherent nature), they progress spiritually without creating bondage.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that the varna system, as originally conceived, was based on qualities and natural tendencies rather than birth alone. A true Brahmana embodies these virtues through their nature and actions. This verse emphasizes that spiritual leadership requires not just intellectual knowledge (jñāna) but also realized wisdom (vijñāna) and practical virtues like self-control and purity. The inclusion of āstikya (faith) indicates that genuine spiritual knowledge must be grounded in reverence for the transcendent reality.",
