  "transliteration": "sarva-karmāṇi manasā saṁnyasyāste sukhaṁ vaśī |\nnava-dvāre pure dehī naiva kurvan na kārayan ||",
  "translation": "Mentally renouncing all actions, the self-controlled soul dwells happily in the city of nine gates, neither acting nor causing action.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of a self-realized person who has achieved true renunciation through knowledge. The 'city of nine gates' (nava-dvāre pure) refers to the human body with its nine openings—two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, and two lower apertures. The enlightened soul (dehī) residing in this body remains in a state of peaceful detachment, understanding that all actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti (material nature) and not by the true Self.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that such a person has mentally renounced (manasā saṁnyasya) all actions, meaning they have transcended the false identification with being the doer. Though the body continues to function and actions occur through it, the wise person neither considers themselves the performer of actions (na kurvan) nor the cause of others' actions (na kārayan). This represents the highest state of karma-yoga where one acts without attachment or ego-identification.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the philosophy of karma-sannyasa presented in this chapter. It demonstrates that true renunciation is not physical abandonment of action but a mental state of non-attachment and non-identification with action. The self-controlled person (vaśī) who has mastered the mind dwells in happiness (sukhaṁ āste) because they are established in the knowledge of their true nature as distinct from the body-mind complex and its activities.",
