  "translation": "If I did not perform action, these worlds would perish; I would be the cause of confusion and disorder, and would destroy all these beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the importance of performing one's duties, even for those who have attained self-realization. He explains that if He Himself were to cease performing action, the entire cosmic order would collapse. Since Krishna is the Supreme Being and the ultimate role model for all creation, His abstention from action would set a disastrous precedent. The worlds (loka) would be destroyed not through direct divine intervention, but through the confusion and chaos (saṅkara) that would arise when people, following His example, abandon their prescribed duties.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding Krishna's teaching on karma yoga in Chapter 3. He is establishing that action is necessary not only for the unenlightened who are bound by desires, but even for the enlightened and the Divine Himself. The key difference lies in the spirit of action—while the ignorant act with attachment to results, the wise act without attachment, purely for the maintenance of world order (lokasamgraha). Krishna uses His own example to demonstrate that renunciation of action is not the path He advocates; rather, it is renunciation of attachment to the fruits of action while continuing to perform one's duties that constitutes true wisdom and spiritual practice.",
