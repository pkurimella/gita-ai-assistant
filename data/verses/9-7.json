  "translation": "O son of Kunti, at the end of a cosmic cycle (kalpa), all beings return to My prakriti (material nature), and at the beginning of the next cycle, I send them forth again.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna reveals the cyclical nature of cosmic manifestation and dissolution. He explains that all beings merge back into His unmanifest prakriti at the end of each cosmic cycle (kalpa), which spans billions of years according to Vedic cosmology. This is not annihilation but a return to the potential, unmanifest state. At the beginning of the next cycle, Krishna again projects these beings forth according to their karmic impressions and tendencies that remain in seed form.\n\nThis verse establishes Krishna's supreme position as the controller of cosmic cycles of creation and dissolution. The term 'māmikām prakṛtim' (My prakriti) indicates that prakriti or material nature is under His complete control and belongs to Him. This teaching addresses the question of what happens to beings during cosmic dissolution and reassures that individual karmic accounts are preserved. The verse emphasizes that despite the vast cosmic processes of creation and dissolution, Krishna remains the unchanging witness and controller, while beings undergo these cycles according to their karma until they attain liberation.",
