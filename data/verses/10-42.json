  "transliteration": "athavā bahunaitena kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna |\nviṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam ekāṁśena sthito jagat ||",
  "translation": "But what is the need for you to know all these details, O Arjuna? I support and pervade this entire universe with just a single fragment of Myself, and yet remain established in My transcendental position.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 10 serves as a powerful culmination to Krishna's extensive description of His divine manifestations. After enumerating numerous examples of His vibhūtis (divine glories) throughout the chapter, Krishna now reveals the ultimate truth: all these manifestations represent merely a fraction of His infinite nature. With just one portion (ekāṁśa) of His being, He sustains the entire cosmos, while His complete essence remains beyond and transcendent.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the incomprehensible magnitude of the Divine. Krishna suggests that even after hearing about countless manifestations, Arjuna has only glimpsed an infinitesimal aspect of the Supreme Reality. The purpose is not to overwhelm with endless details, but to inspire devotion and wonder at the infinite nature of God. This understanding prepares Arjuna for the Viśvarūpa darśana (vision of the Universal Form) that will follow in Chapter 11, where he will directly perceive this cosmic reality.\n\nPhilosophically, this verse establishes the principle of divine immanence and transcendence simultaneously. God pervades everything (viṣṭabhya) yet remains beyond everything. This paradox is central to Vedāntic thought—the Supreme is both within creation and beyond it, supporting all existence while remaining unaffected and complete in Himself. It reminds spiritual seekers that intellectual understanding has limits, and direct realization through devotion and grace is the ultimate goal.",
