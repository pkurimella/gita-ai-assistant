  "sanskrit": "इदं ते नातपस्काय नाभक्ताय कदाचन |\nन चाशुश्रूषवे वाच्यं न च मां योऽभ्यसूयति ||",
  "transliteration": "idaṁ te nātapaskāya nābhaktāya kadācana |\nna cāśuśrūṣave vācyaṁ na ca māṁ yo'bhyasūyati ||",
  "translation": "This knowledge should never be taught to one who is devoid of austerity, nor to one who is not devoted, nor to one who does not render service, nor to one who speaks ill of Me or finds fault with Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes clear guidelines about who is qualified to receive the sacred teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. He specifies four types of people to whom this knowledge should not be imparted: those lacking in spiritual discipline (tapas), those without devotion (bhakti), those unwilling to serve or listen with reverence (śuśrūṣā), and those who are envious or critical of the Divine. This restriction is not born of exclusivity but of practical wisdom—such individuals lack the necessary receptivity and respect to properly understand and benefit from these profound teachings.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that spiritual knowledge requires proper qualification in the recipient. Without austerity, one lacks the self-discipline needed for spiritual practice; without devotion, one lacks the heart-connection to the Divine; without the attitude of service and humble listening, one lacks the openness to receive; and with a critical, fault-finding attitude toward God, one creates an insurmountable barrier to understanding. These qualifications ensure that the sacred teachings are preserved in their purity and transmitted only to those who will honor them and put them into practice.\n\nThis instruction also protects both the teaching and the teacher. Sharing profound spiritual wisdom with those who are unprepared or hostile can lead to misunderstanding, misuse, or ridicule of the sacred knowledge. Krishna's guidance here reflects the traditional guru-disciple relationship where the teacher must discern the readiness and sincerity of the student before imparting higher knowledge.",
