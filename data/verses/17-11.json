  "sanskrit": "अफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्यज्ञो विधिदिष्टो य इज्यते।\nयष्टव्यमेवेति मनः समाधाय स सात्त्विकः॥",
  "transliteration": "aphalākāṅkṣibhir yajño vidhidiṣṭo ya ijyate |\nyaṣṭavyam eveti manaḥ samādhāya sa sāttvikaḥ ||",
  "translation": "That sacrifice which is performed according to scriptural injunctions, without desire for fruits, with the firm conviction in the mind that it is simply a duty to be performed—such sacrifice is of the nature of goodness (sattvic).",
  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's explanation of the three types of sacrifice (yajna) based on the three gunas. A sattvic sacrifice is characterized by three essential qualities: it is performed according to prescribed scriptural methods (vidhidishta), it is done without expectation of personal reward or fruit (aphalakankshi), and it is undertaken with the mental conviction that it is one's duty (yashtavyam eva). The emphasis on 'yashtavyam eva' (it must be performed) indicates a sense of obligation arising from dharma rather than personal desire.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of nishkama karma (desireless action). The sattvic performer of sacrifice understands that the act itself is the goal, not any material or heavenly reward that might result from it. By establishing the mind firmly (samādhāya) in this understanding, the practitioner transcends the binding nature of action. This verse establishes the ideal standard against which the rajasic and tamasic sacrifices in subsequent verses will be contrasted, showing how the quality of one's faith and intention determines the spiritual value of ritual action.",
