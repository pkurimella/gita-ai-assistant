  "sanskrit": "प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुराः ।\nन शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते ॥७॥",
  "transliteration": "pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ |\nna śaucaṁ nāpi cācāro na satyaṁ teṣu vidyate ||7||",
  "translation": "Those of demoniac nature know neither what to do nor what to refrain from doing. Neither purity, nor good conduct, nor truth is found in them.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins to describe the characteristics of those possessing āsurī sampad (demoniac qualities), contrasting them with the divine qualities enumerated earlier. The verse identifies three fundamental deficiencies in those of demoniac nature: they lack understanding of pravṛtti (action, engagement) and nivṛtti (withdrawal, renunciation), meaning they do not know when to act and when to refrain from action. This ignorance stems from their disconnection from dharmic principles and spiritual wisdom.\n\nThe verse further states that such individuals are devoid of three essential qualities: śauca (purity, both external cleanliness and internal purity of mind), ācāra (right conduct, ethical behavior according to dharma), and satya (truthfulness). These absences indicate a complete moral and spiritual bankruptcy. Without understanding the principles of right action and restraint, and without purity, good conduct, and truthfulness, such persons become instruments of adharma in the world. This verse serves as a foundational description of the demoniac temperament that Krishna will elaborate upon in subsequent verses, showing how such qualities lead to bondage and suffering rather than liberation.",
