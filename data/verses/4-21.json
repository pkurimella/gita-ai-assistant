  "translation": "Free from desires, with mind and self controlled, having abandoned all possessions, performing only bodily action for maintenance, one incurs no sin.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the characteristics of a true karma-yogi who acts without incurring karmic bondage. The verse emphasizes three key qualities: being free from desires (nirāśīḥ), having complete control over mind and self (yata-cittātmā), and having renounced all sense of possession (tyakta-sarva-parigrahaḥ). Such a person performs only the bare minimum actions necessary for bodily maintenance—eating, sleeping, and basic survival—without any attachment or expectation of results.\n\nThe phrase 'śārīraṁ kevalaṁ karma' refers to actions performed merely to sustain the body, not for personal gratification or accumulation. When actions are performed in this spirit of complete detachment and renunciation of ownership, they do not bind the doer with sin or karmic consequences (kilbiṣam). This verse illustrates the practical application of karma yoga, where the focus is not on abandoning action itself, but on abandoning the sense of doership, desire for results, and attachment to possessions.\n\nThis teaching is central to Chapter 4's theme of reconciling knowledge and action. Krishna demonstrates that true renunciation is internal—a renunciation of desires and possessiveness—rather than external abandonment of duties. Such a person lives in the world, performs necessary actions, yet remains untouched by their karmic implications, having transcended the ego-sense that creates bondage.",
