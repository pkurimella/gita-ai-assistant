  "translation": "Whatever a great person does, common people follow. Whatever standards they set by their actions, the world pursues.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the profound responsibility of leadership and the power of exemplary conduct. He explains that people naturally emulate those they consider superior or authoritative—whether in knowledge, position, or spiritual attainment. The actions of great individuals (śreṣṭha) become the standard (pramāṇa) by which others measure their own behavior. This principle applies across all levels of society, from spiritual teachers to political leaders to anyone in a position of influence.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Krishna's argument to Arjuna. Krishna is building toward revealing (in the next verse) that even He, though having nothing to gain, continues to perform action to set an example for humanity. The implication for Arjuna is clear: as a prince and warrior of high standing, his actions will influence countless others. If he abandons his duty, others may follow suit, leading to social chaos. The verse underscores that those with knowledge, power, or status cannot act solely for themselves—they bear the weight of collective influence.\n\nThe philosophical significance extends to the concept of dharma and social order. Leadership is not merely about authority but about moral responsibility. The verse suggests that societal transformation begins with the transformation of its leaders and exemplars. This teaching remains relevant across time, reminding those in positions of influence that their conduct shapes collective consciousness and behavior patterns.",
