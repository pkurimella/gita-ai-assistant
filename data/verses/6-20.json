  "translation": "When the mind, restrained through the practice of yoga, attains quietude, and when seeing the Self by the self, one is satisfied in the Self alone.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Krishna's description of the state of perfect meditation and self-realization. It describes the condition where the restless mind, through disciplined practice of yoga, becomes completely still and withdrawn from external objects. In this state of mental tranquility (uparama), the practitioner experiences the profound joy of self-perception—the Self beholding itself without the mediation of the senses or mind.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two key aspects of yogic accomplishment: first, the cessation of mental modifications (citta-niruddha) through consistent practice (yoga-sevaya), and second, the resulting self-contentment (atma-tushti) that arises from direct self-knowledge. This is not intellectual understanding but experiential realization where the individual soul recognizes its true nature. The satisfaction mentioned here is complete and self-sufficient, requiring nothing external for fulfillment.\n\nThis verse is significant in the context of Chapter 6 as it describes the fruition of the meditation practices outlined earlier. It represents the transition from the methodology of yoga to its ultimate achievement—a state of pure consciousness where the observer, the observed, and the act of observation merge into one unified experience of the Self. This state of contentment in the Self alone (atmani tushyati) is the foundation for the supreme peace and liberation that Krishna will elaborate upon in subsequent verses.",
