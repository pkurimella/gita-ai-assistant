  "sanskrit": "यजन्ते सात्त्विका देवान्यक्षरक्षांसि राजसाः |\nप्रेतान्भूतगणांश्चान्ये यजन्ते तामसा जनाः ||",
  "transliteration": "yajante sāttvikā devān yakṣa-rakṣāṁsi rājasāḥ |\npretān bhūta-gaṇāṁś cānye yajante tāmasā janāḥ ||",
  "translation": "Those in the mode of goodness worship the gods; those in the mode of passion worship the yakṣas and rākṣasas; while those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.",
  "commentary": "This verse establishes a direct correlation between the three guṇas (modes of material nature) and the objects of worship chosen by individuals. Krishna explains that one's faith and the deity one worships are determined by one's inherent nature shaped by the predominant guṇa. Those dominated by sattva (goodness) naturally gravitate toward worshiping the devas (celestial beings and higher principles), seeking knowledge, purity, and spiritual elevation. Those influenced by rajas (passion) worship yakṣas (nature spirits associated with wealth) and rākṣasas (powerful beings), driven by desires for power, material success, and worldly achievements.\n\nThose under the influence of tamas (ignorance) worship pretas (ghosts of the deceased) and bhūta-gaṇas (elemental spirits and lower entities), often seeking to fulfill base desires, engage in harmful practices, or remain bound by superstition and fear. This verse is crucial in understanding that the object of one's devotion reveals the quality of one's consciousness. It demonstrates that faith itself is not uniform but takes different forms based on one's psychological and spiritual development. Krishna is not condemning these worshipers but explaining the natural law that governs spiritual inclinations, preparing Arjuna to understand how to elevate one's faith from lower to higher modes through proper discrimination and practice.",
