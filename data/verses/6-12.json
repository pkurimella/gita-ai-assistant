  "sanskrit": "तत्रैकाग्रं मनः कृत्वा यतचित्तेन्द्रियक्रियः।\nउपविश्यासने युञ्ज्याद्योगमात्मविशुद्धये॥",
  "transliteration": "tatraikāgraṁ manaḥ kṛtvā yata-cittendriya-kriyaḥ |\nupaviśyāsane yuñjyād yogam ātma-viśuddhaye ||",
  "translation": "Seated there on the seat, making the mind one-pointed, with the activities of the mind and senses controlled, one should practice yoga for the purification of the self.",
  "commentary": "This verse provides practical instruction on how to practice meditation once the proper seat has been established (as described in the previous verse). Krishna emphasizes that the practitioner must cultivate ekāgratā (one-pointedness) of mind, which is essential for successful meditation. The mind must be focused on a single object or point of concentration, rather than being scattered among various thoughts and sensory impressions. Additionally, the yogi must exercise control over both the mind (citta) and the senses (indriya), restraining their natural tendency to wander toward external objects.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of this yogic practice is clearly stated as ātma-viśuddhi, the purification of the self or soul. This purification involves removing the impurities of desire, attachment, aversion, and ignorance that cloud one's true nature. Through sustained practice of meditation with proper posture, mental focus, and sensory control, the practitioner gradually cleanses the consciousness and prepares it for higher spiritual realization. This verse thus connects the external preparations (proper seat and posture) with the internal discipline (mental concentration and sensory restraint) necessary for authentic spiritual progress in the path of dhyana yoga.",
