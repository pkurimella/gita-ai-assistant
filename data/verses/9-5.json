  "transliteration": "na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni paśya me yogam aiśvaram | bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ ||",
  "translation": "And yet, beings do not dwell in Me. Behold My divine yoga! My Self is the sustainer of all beings, yet It does not dwell in beings; It is the source of all beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents a profound paradox that reveals the transcendent nature of divine reality. After stating in the previous verse that all beings exist in Him, He now declares that beings do not actually dwell in Him. This apparent contradiction is resolved through understanding His 'divine yoga' (yogam aiśvaram) - the mysterious power by which the Supreme simultaneously pervades all creation while remaining completely untouched and unaffected by it. This is the unique capacity of the Divine to be both immanent and transcendent.\n\nKrishna explains that though His Self (ātmā) sustains all beings (bhūta-bhṛt) and is the source of their existence (bhūta-bhāvana), He does not actually reside within beings (na bhūta-sthaḥ) in the sense of being limited or conditioned by them. This illustrates the Vedantic principle that Brahman is both the material and efficient cause of the universe, yet remains forever unchanged and unaffected by creation. The Supreme is like space that contains everything yet is not contaminated by anything within it.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding the chapter's teaching about divine transcendence and immanence. It reveals that God's relationship with creation is not one of mutual dependence but of absolute sovereignty. While the world depends entirely on God for its existence, God remains completely independent and self-sufficient. This understanding is meant to inspire both devotion (recognizing God's sustaining power) and wisdom (understanding His transcendent nature), which are the twin themes of this chapter on royal knowledge.",
