  "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca |\nūrdhva-mūlam adhaḥ-śākham aśvatthaṁ prāhur avyayam |\nchandāṁsi yasya parṇāni yas taṁ veda sa veda-vit || 1 ||",
  "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: They speak of the eternal Aśvattha tree having its roots above and branches below, whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is a knower of the Vedas.",
  "commentary": "This verse opens the fifteenth chapter with one of the most profound metaphors in the Bhagavad Gita—the inverted Aśvattha tree (sacred fig or banyan tree) representing material existence. The tree has its roots above in the Supreme Reality (Brahman) and branches extending downward into the material world. This imagery illustrates how the phenomenal world emanates from and depends upon the transcendent reality. The tree is called 'avyaya' (imperishable) because saṁsāra continues perpetually for those who remain ignorant, though it can be transcended through knowledge.\n\nThe leaves of this cosmic tree are described as the Vedic hymns (chandāṁsi), suggesting that the Vedas both describe and regulate the functioning of material existence. The various rituals, duties, and injunctions of the Vedas govern the workings of this world-tree. One who truly understands this metaphor—comprehending both the dependent nature of material existence and its source in the Supreme—is called a 'veda-vit' (knower of the Vedas). This indicates that mere ritualistic knowledge is insufficient; true Vedic wisdom means understanding the illusory nature of material existence and its relationship to ultimate reality.\n\nThis verse sets the stage for the chapter's central teaching about transcending material bondage and realizing the Puruṣottama (Supreme Person) who is beyond both the perishable and imperishable aspects of existence. The metaphor will be developed further in subsequent verses, ultimately leading to instruction on cutting down this tree of attachment with the weapon of detachment.",
