  "translation": "But distinct from both the perishable and the imperishable is the Supreme Person, called the Paramātman (Supreme Self), who, pervading the three worlds, sustains them as the imperishable Lord.",
  "commentary": "In this pivotal verse, Krishna introduces the concept of Puruṣottama—the Supreme Person who transcends both the kṣara (perishable) and akṣara (imperishable) principles described in the previous verses. While the perishable refers to all changing beings in material existence and the imperishable refers to the unchanging witness consciousness, the Puruṣottama is beyond both, being the ultimate source and sustainer of all existence. This Supreme Person is identified as Paramātman, the Supreme Self that pervades and maintains the three worlds (triloka: earth, intermediate space, and heaven, or alternatively the physical, subtle, and causal realms).\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this Supreme Person is 'avyaya' (imperishable) and 'īśvara' (the Lord), indicating both His transcendent nature and His role as the controller and sustainer of all existence. Unlike the imperishable principle which is passive, the Puruṣottama actively enters into (āviśya) and supports (bibharti) all the worlds. This establishes the theistic dimension of Vedānta, where the Absolute is not merely an impersonal principle but the Supreme Person who combines transcendence with immanence. This verse provides the philosophical foundation for understanding why this chapter is titled 'Puruṣottama Yoga'—the yoga of realizing and uniting with the Supreme Person who is beyond all dualities and categories.",
