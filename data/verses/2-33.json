  "translation": "But if you do not perform this righteous duty of battle, then having abandoned your own duty and fame, you will incur sin.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna presents the negative consequences of Arjuna's refusal to fight. After explaining the positive reasons for engaging in battle—the immortality of the soul, the warrior's duty, and the path to heaven—Krishna now warns of the consequences of inaction. By refusing to fight this righteous war (dharmyaṁ saṅgrāmam), Arjuna would be abandoning his svadharma, his own duty as a Kṣatriya warrior, which is fundamental to the social and cosmic order.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that Arjuna's withdrawal would result in three losses: the abandonment of his prescribed duty (svadharma), the loss of his reputation and fame (kīrti), and the accumulation of sin (pāpa). For a warrior of Arjuna's stature, reputation and honor are paramount. His refusal to fight would be seen not as compassion but as cowardice, bringing dishonor to his name. More significantly, by shirking his duty at this critical moment, he would incur sin—not through action, but through inaction when action is required.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the Gita's teaching on dharma and karma. It establishes that inaction in the face of one's duty is not neutrality but a form of adharma (unrighteousness). The concept being developed here is that one must perform one's prescribed duties according to one's nature and position in society, and that abandoning these duties has serious spiritual consequences. This sets the stage for Krishna's later teachings on Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action.",
