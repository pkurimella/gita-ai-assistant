  "transliteration": "yudhāmanyuś ca vikrānta uttamaujāś ca vīryavān |\nsaubhadro draupadeyāś ca sarva eva mahārathāḥ ||",
  "translation": "And the valiant Yudhamanyu, and the powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu), and the sons of Draupadi—all of them are great chariot warriors.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Dhritarashtra continues his enumeration of the mighty warriors assembled on the Pandava side. He mentions Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja, both renowned for their valor and strength. More significantly, he refers to Abhimanyu (the son of Subhadra and Arjuna) and the five sons of Draupadi, collectively known as the Upapandavas. By addressing them as 'mahārathāḥ' (great chariot warriors), Dhritarashtra acknowledges their exceptional martial prowess.\n\nThis verse reveals Dhritarashtra's deep anxiety about the outcome of the war. Despite his outward support for his sons, his detailed cataloging of the Pandava forces betrays his inner recognition of their formidable strength. The mention of the younger generation—Abhimanyu and Draupadi's sons—is particularly poignant, as it foreshadows the tragic loss of youth that this war will bring. The verse serves to establish the gravity of the conflict and the high stakes involved, setting the stage for Arjuna's moral crisis that forms the heart of the Gita's teachings.",
