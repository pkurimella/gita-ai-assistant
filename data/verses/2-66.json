  "sanskrit": "नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना |\nन चाभावयतः शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुतः सुखम् ||",
  "transliteration": "nāsti buddhir ayuktasya na cāyuktasya bhāvanā |\nna cābhāvayataḥ śāntir aśāntasya kutaḥ sukham ||",
  "translation": "There is no knowledge for one who is not united (with the Self); nor is there meditation for the unsteady. For one without meditation, there is no peace; and for one without peace, how can there be happiness?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes a crucial chain of spiritual causation, demonstrating how the absence of self-control leads to the complete absence of happiness. The 'ayukta' (uncontrolled person) lacks buddhi (discriminative intelligence) because their mind is scattered among sense objects. Without this steady intelligence, there can be no bhāvanā (contemplation or meditation), as the mind remains too agitated to focus on higher truths.\n\nThe verse then progresses to show that without meditation or contemplation, there can be no śānti (peace). This peace is not merely the absence of external disturbance, but the inner tranquility that comes from self-knowledge and spiritual practice. Finally, Krishna poses a rhetorical question: how can one who lacks peace ever experience sukha (true happiness)? This establishes that genuine happiness is impossible without the foundation of inner peace, which itself depends on meditation, which requires disciplined intelligence.\n\nThis verse fits perfectly within Chapter 2's broader teaching on sthitaprajña (the person of steady wisdom). Krishna is contrasting the fate of the disciplined yogi with that of the undisciplined person, showing that spiritual discipline is not optional but essential for human fulfillment. The verse serves as a warning about the consequences of allowing the senses and mind to remain uncontrolled, while implicitly encouraging Arjuna to pursue the path of yoga and self-mastery.",
