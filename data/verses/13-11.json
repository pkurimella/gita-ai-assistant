  "sanskrit": "मयि चानन्ययोगेन भक्तिरव्यभिचारिणी।\nविविक्तदेशसेवित्वमरतिर्जनसंसदि॥",
  "transliteration": "mayi cānanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhicāriṇī |\nvivikta-deśa-sevitvam aratir jana-saṁsadi ||",
  "translation": "Unswerving devotion to Me through single-minded yoga, resorting to solitary places, and distaste for the company of worldly people.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's enumeration of the qualities that constitute true knowledge (jñāna). Here, Krishna emphasizes three interconnected spiritual practices. First is 'ananya-yogena bhakti' - exclusive, unwavering devotion to the Divine through single-pointed yoga practice. The term 'avyabhicāriṇī' indicates devotion that does not deviate or waver, remaining constant under all circumstances. This represents the bhakti aspect of spiritual development, showing that true knowledge is inseparable from devotion.\n\nThe second and third qualities relate to the external environment conducive to spiritual growth. 'Vivikta-deśa-sevitvam' refers to the practice of seeking solitary, quiet places for meditation and contemplation, away from the distractions of worldly life. This is complemented by 'aratir jana-saṁsadi' - a natural disinclination toward crowds and frivolous social gatherings. This doesn't imply misanthropy or antisocial behavior, but rather a preference for environments that support inner reflection over mere social entertainment. These practices help the seeker maintain focus on the higher goal of Self-realization, recognizing that the company we keep and the environments we frequent significantly influence our spiritual progress. Together, these qualities create the conditions necessary for deepening one's understanding of the distinction between the field (kṣetra) and its knower (kṣetrajña).",
