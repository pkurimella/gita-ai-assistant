  "translation": "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.",
  "commentary": "This is one of the most celebrated verses of the Bhagavad Gita, encapsulating the essence of Karma Yoga. Krishna instructs Arjuna that while he has complete authority and responsibility over his actions (karma), he has no control over the results (phala). This teaching liberates one from anxiety about outcomes and the bondage that comes from attachment to results. The verse emphasizes performing one's duty with full dedication while maintaining equanimity toward success or failure.\n\nThe second part of the verse contains a dual warning. First, one should not become motivated solely by desire for fruits, as this creates attachment and subsequent suffering. Second, one should not use this teaching as an excuse for inaction or laziness. The path of Karma Yoga requires active engagement in one's duties, performed with skill and detachment. This verse addresses Arjuna's dilemma directly—he must fight (his dharma as a warrior) but without attachment to victory, defeat, or their consequences.\n\nThis teaching has profound philosophical implications for spiritual practice and daily life. It establishes the foundation for nishkama karma (desireless action), which purifies the mind and prepares it for higher knowledge. By focusing on the action itself rather than its fruits, one develops equanimity (samatva) and gradually transcends the ego's claim to doership. This verse bridges the Sankhya philosophy discussed earlier in the chapter with the practical path of Karma Yoga, showing how knowledge translates into action.",
