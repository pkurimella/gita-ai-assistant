  "sanskrit": "कामैस्तैस्तैर्हृतज्ञानाः प्रपद्यन्तेऽन्यदेवताः।\nतं तं नियममास्थाय प्रकृत्या नियताः स्वया॥",
  "transliteration": "kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante'nya-devatāḥ |\ntaṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya prakṛtyā niyatāḥ svayā ||",
  "translation": "Those whose wisdom has been carried away by various desires surrender to other gods, following various rites and rituals, constrained by their own nature.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna explains why people worship demigods and lesser deities instead of the Supreme. He states that those whose discrimination has been clouded by material desires (kāmais hṛta-jñānāḥ) turn to various deities for fulfillment of specific worldly wishes. These individuals adopt particular religious observances and rituals appropriate to each deity they worship, driven by their own inherent nature and conditioning.\n\nKrishna is not condemning such worship outright, but rather explaining its limited nature and underlying motivation. People approach different gods for different material benefits—wealth, power, progeny, health, etc.—because their understanding is obscured by immediate desires. Their own nature (prakṛti), shaped by past impressions and tendencies, compels them toward these limited objectives. This verse contextualizes the earlier discussion about the four types of devotees, showing that desire-driven worship, while valid, represents a lower stage of spiritual evolution compared to worship of the Supreme with knowledge and devotion.",
