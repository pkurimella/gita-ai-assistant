  "sanskrit": "धृत्या यया धारयते मनःप्राणेन्द्रियक्रियाः।\nयोगेनाव्यभिचारिण्या धृतिः सा पार्थ राजसी।।",
  "transliteration": "dhṛtyā yayā dhārayate manaḥprāṇendriyakriyāḥ |\nyogenāvyabhicāriṇyā dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha rājasī ||",
  "translation": "The determination by which one holds fast to the activities of the mind, life-force, and senses, through unwavering yoga, with desire for the fruits of action—that determination, O Partha, is of the nature of rajas (passion).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes rajasic determination, the second type in the threefold classification of dhṛti (steadfastness). While this determination appears disciplined and focused—maintaining control over mind, prāṇa, and senses through yoga—it is fundamentally motivated by attachment to results. The practitioner exercises self-control and perseverance, but the underlying motivation is the desire for rewards, whether worldly success, heavenly pleasures, or personal gain.\n\nThe key distinction from sattvic determination (described in the previous verse) lies in the phrase 'avyabhicāriṇyā yogena'—though the yoga practice is unwavering and consistent, it is tainted by expectation of fruits. This creates a paradox: the person demonstrates admirable discipline and commitment, yet remains bound by desires and attachments. Such determination may lead to temporary achievements and relative success, but cannot produce the ultimate freedom that comes from selfless action. This verse illustrates how even spiritual practices can be colored by the guṇas, and how the quality of one's motivation determines the spiritual efficacy of one's efforts, not merely the external form of practice.",
