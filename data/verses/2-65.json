  "translation": "In that state of serenity, all sorrows are destroyed. Indeed, for one whose mind is tranquil, the intellect soon becomes firmly established in the Self.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the positive outcomes that arise from the state of prasāda (grace or serenity) mentioned in the previous verse. When a devotee attains mental tranquility through control of the senses and devotion to the Supreme, all forms of suffering are eliminated. This is not merely a temporary relief but a fundamental destruction of the root causes of sorrow that arise from attachment and aversion.\n\nKrishna emphasizes that for one whose consciousness (cetaḥ) has become prasanna (clear and serene), the buddhi (intellect or discriminative faculty) quickly becomes established in steady wisdom. This stable intellect is characterized by viveka (discrimination) and vairāgya (dispassion), enabling the practitioner to remain anchored in Self-knowledge. The word 'āśu' (quickly) indicates that once the mind achieves genuine tranquility, spiritual progress accelerates naturally.\n\nThis verse completes the sequence Krishna has been developing: sense control leads to mental peace, mental peace destroys all suffering, and freedom from suffering allows the intellect to become firmly established in the highest truth. This represents the culmination of the disciplined path described in the preceding verses, showing how external discipline of the senses ultimately results in internal stability and liberation from all forms of mental anguish.",
