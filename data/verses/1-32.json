  "sanskrit": "न काङ्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च ।\nकिं नो राज्येन गोविन्द किं भोगैर्जीवितेन वा ॥",
  "transliteration": "na kāṅkṣe vijayaṃ kṛṣṇa na ca rājyaṃ sukhāni ca |\nkiṃ no rājyena govinda kiṃ bhogair jīvitena vā ||",
  "translation": "O Krishna, I do not desire victory, nor kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what use is kingdom to us, O Govinda, or enjoyments, or even life itself?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna begins to articulate his moral dilemma and emotional crisis to Krishna. Having surveyed the battlefield and recognized his kinsmen, teachers, and friends arrayed on both sides, Arjuna experiences a profound crisis of purpose. He questions the very goals that motivated him to enter this war—victory, kingdom, and the pleasures of sovereignty. This represents a crucial turning point where Arjuna's warrior duty (kshatriya dharma) comes into direct conflict with his emotional attachments and moral concerns about killing his own relatives.\n\nArjuna addresses Krishna by two significant names here: 'Krishna' (the dark one, the all-attractive) and 'Govinda' (protector of cows, lord of the senses). By using these intimate names, Arjuna appeals to Krishna not merely as his charioteer but as his friend and guide. His rhetorical questions reveal a state of complete disillusionment with worldly goals. This verse sets the stage for the entire Bhagavad Gita's teaching, as it is precisely this crisis—the apparent meaninglessness of action when faced with moral complexity—that Krishna will address through his discourse on dharma, karma yoga, and the nature of the self. Arjuna's despair, though born of confusion, represents an important spiritual moment where worldly attachments are being questioned, even if for the wrong reasons.",
