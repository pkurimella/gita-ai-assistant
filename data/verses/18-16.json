  "transliteration": "tatraivaṁ sati kartāram ātmānaṁ kevalaṁ tu yaḥ |\npaśyaty akṛta-buddhitvān na sa paśyati durmatiḥ ||",
  "translation": "Such being the case, one who, due to untrained understanding, sees only the Self as the sole agent of action—that person of impure intellect does not see truly.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a fundamental error in understanding the nature of action and agency. Having just explained the five factors involved in the accomplishment of any action (the body, the doer, the various senses, the different kinds of efforts, and destiny or divine will), Krishna now warns against the ignorant view that considers the pure Self (Atman) as the sole doer of actions. This misconception arises from akṛta-buddhi—an untrained, immature, or unpurified intellect that has not been refined through proper knowledge and discrimination.\n\nThe verse criticizes those who, despite the complex interplay of multiple factors in action, reduce everything to the Self alone as the agent. This represents a misunderstanding of both Vedantic philosophy and the practical mechanics of karma. Such a person is called 'durmati' (one of impure or foolish intellect) because they fail to recognize that actions occur through the combination of body, mind, senses, effort, and divine ordinance, while the true Self remains the unchanging witness. This verse is crucial in the Gita's teaching on karma-yoga, as it refutes both the extreme of considering oneself the absolute doer (leading to ego and attachment) and the misapplication of Vedantic knowledge that might lead to fatalism or irresponsibility. True wisdom lies in understanding the distinction between the empirical self that acts through various instruments and the transcendental Self that remains untouched by action.",
