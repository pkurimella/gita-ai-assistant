  "transliteration": "yajñārthāt karmaṇo'nyatra loko'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ |\ntad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara ||",
  "translation": "Work done as a sacrifice for Vishnu has to be performed, otherwise work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most fundamental teachings of the Bhagavad Gita regarding action. Krishna explains that all work performed for any purpose other than yajña (sacrifice or offering to the Divine) binds one to the material world through the law of karma. However, when actions are performed as an offering to the Supreme, they do not create karmic bondage but instead become a means of liberation. This transforms ordinary work into spiritual practice.\n\nThe key instruction here is to perform one's duties (karma) while remaining mukta-saṅga—free from attachment to the fruits of action. This doesn't mean renouncing action itself, but rather renouncing the sense of personal ownership and desire for results. By dedicating all actions to the Divine (yajñārtha), work becomes purified and ceases to bind the soul. This verse establishes the foundation of Karma Yoga, showing how one can remain engaged in worldly activities while simultaneously progressing spiritually. It reconciles the apparent contradiction between action and liberation, demonstrating that the problem is not action itself but the selfish motivation and attachment behind it.",
