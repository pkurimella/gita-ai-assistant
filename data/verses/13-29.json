  "sanskrit": "प्रकृत्यैव च कर्माणि क्रियमाणानि सर्वशः |\nयः पश्यति तथात्मानमकर्तारं स पश्यति ||",
  "transliteration": "prakṛtyaiva ca karmāṇi kriyamāṇāni sarvaśaḥ |\nyaḥ paśyati tathātmānam akartāraṁ sa paśyati ||",
  "translation": "One who sees that all actions are performed by Prakriti (material nature) alone, and that the Self is not the doer—such a person truly sees.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a fundamental teaching of Sankhya philosophy integrated into the Gita's framework. Krishna explains that true vision consists of recognizing that all actions are performed by Prakriti—the material nature consisting of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas). The body, senses, mind, and intellect are all products of Prakriti, and it is through these instruments that all actions occur. The Atman (Self), being pure consciousness, remains ever untouched by action and is therefore akartā (non-doer).\n\nThis understanding is crucial for spiritual liberation because it dissolves the false identification between the Self and the body-mind complex. When one mistakenly identifies with Prakriti and its modifications, one assumes doership and becomes bound by karma. However, when one realizes through discrimination that the Self is distinct from Prakriti and merely witnesses all activities without participating in them, one attains freedom from karmic bondage. This verse directly relates to the chapter's central theme of distinguishing between kṣetra (the field of matter) and kṣetrajña (the knower of the field, the Self).\n\nThe practical implication of this teaching is profound: it enables the seeker to perform all necessary duties while remaining internally detached, knowing that the true Self is never the agent of action. This wisdom transforms one's relationship with action from bondage to liberation, allowing one to live in the world while remaining spiritually free.",
