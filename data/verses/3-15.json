  "transliteration": "karma brahmodbhavaṁ viddhi brahmākṣara-samudbhavam |\ntasmāt sarva-gataṁ brahma nityaṁ yajñe pratiṣṭhitam ||",
  "translation": "Know that action arises from Brahma (the Vedas), and Brahma arises from the Imperishable (Supreme Being). Therefore, the all-pervading Brahma is eternally established in sacrifice.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna establishes the divine origin and cosmic significance of action (karma). He traces a hierarchical chain: prescribed actions originate from the Vedas (Brahma), the Vedas emanate from the eternal, imperishable Supreme Reality (Akshara Brahman), and therefore all ritualistic and righteous actions are inherently connected to the divine. This verse emphasizes that karma is not merely mundane activity but has sacred roots in the cosmic order.\n\nThe term 'yajña' (sacrifice) here represents not just ritualistic offerings but all actions performed in the spirit of service and duty. Krishna is explaining that the all-pervading Brahman is eternally present in such selfless actions. This teaching counters the notion that spiritual life requires abandonment of action; instead, it reveals that properly understood action is itself a form of worship and a manifestation of the divine order. By understanding this connection, one transforms ordinary duties into spiritual practice, recognizing that the cosmic law (dharma) and prescribed duties are expressions of the Supreme Reality itself.",
