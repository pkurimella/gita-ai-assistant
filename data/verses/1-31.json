  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection",
  "sanskrit": "निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव।\nन च श्रेयोऽनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे॥",
  "transliteration": "nimittāni ca paśyāmi viparītāni keśava |\nna ca śreyo'nupaśyāmi hatvā svajanam āhave ||",
  "translation": "I see omens that are adverse, O Keshava (Krishna). I do not foresee any good in killing my own kinsmen in battle.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses his perception of inauspicious omens on the battlefield. He addresses Krishna as 'Keshava,' one who has beautiful hair, or one who is the slayer of the demon Keshi. Arjuna's observation of adverse signs (viparītāni nimittāni) reflects his disturbed mental state and his attempt to rationalize his reluctance to fight through external portents. This represents a common human tendency to seek external validation for internal conflicts.\n\nArjuna's declaration that he cannot foresee any good (śreya) in killing his relatives reveals his moral confusion. He is unable to reconcile his duty as a warrior (kshatriya dharma) with his emotional attachment to his kinsmen. The word 'svajana' (one's own people) emphasizes the personal nature of this conflict - these are not merely enemies but his own family members, teachers, and friends. This verse marks a deepening of Arjuna's despondency as he moves from emotional arguments to attempting rational justification for his position.\n\nThis verse is significant in the overall structure of the Gita as it represents the culmination of Arjuna's arguments against fighting. His inability to see any beneficial outcome sets the stage for Krishna's comprehensive teaching that will address not just the immediate situation but the fundamental questions of duty, action, and the nature of reality itself. Arjuna's confusion here is the darkness that Krishna's wisdom will illuminate.",
