  "sanskrit": "पितासि लोकस्य चराचरस्य त्वमस्य पूज्यश्च गुरुर्गरीयान्।\nन त्वत्समोऽस्त्यभ्यधिकः कुतोऽन्यो लोकत्रयेऽप्यप्रतिमप्रभाव॥",
  "transliteration": "pitāsi lokasya carācarasya tvam asya pūjyaś ca gurur garīyān |\nna tvat-samo 'sty abhyadhikaḥ kuto 'nyo loka-traye 'py apratima-prabhāva ||",
  "translation": "You are the Father of this world of the moving and unmoving. You are its venerable teacher, most worthy of worship. None is equal to You; how then could there be one greater than You in the three worlds, O Being of incomparable power?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his prayer of supplication and praise after witnessing the terrifying aspects of Krishna's universal form. He acknowledges Krishna's supreme position as the Father (pitā) and Guru (teacher) of all existence, encompassing both the animate (cara) and inanimate (acara) creation. This recognition goes beyond mere biological or pedagogical relationships—it establishes Krishna as the ultimate source, sustainer, and guide of all reality.\n\nArjuna emphasizes Krishna's absolute uniqueness and supremacy by declaring that no one in the three worlds (triloka—heaven, earth, and the netherworld) can equal Him, let alone surpass Him. The term 'apratima-prabhāva' (incomparable power) underscores the infinite nature of the Divine, which transcends all comparative measures. This verse reflects the devotional sentiment (bhakti) that naturally arises when one truly comprehends the magnitude of the Supreme Reality.\n\nThis acknowledgment serves as a prelude to Arjuna's subsequent request for Krishna to return to His gentle, familiar form. By first establishing Krishna's supreme position and expressing complete surrender, Arjuna demonstrates the proper attitude of a devotee approaching the Divine—one of reverence, humility, and recognition of one's own limitations in the face of infinite majesty.",
