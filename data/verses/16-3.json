  "sanskrit": "तेजः क्षमा धृतिः शौचमद्रोहो नातिमानिता।\nभवन्ति सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातस्य भारत॥",
  "transliteration": "tejaḥ kṣamā dhṛtiḥ śaucam adroho nātimānitā |\nbhavanti sampadaṁ daivīm abhijātasya bhārata ||",
  "translation": "Vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of malice, and freedom from excessive pride—these qualities belong to one born with divine endowments, O Bharata.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues the enumeration of divine qualities (daivi sampat) that Krishna began in the previous verses. The six qualities mentioned here complete the comprehensive list of twenty-six divine attributes. Tejas (vigor or spiritual radiance) represents the inner strength and brilliance that comes from spiritual practice. Kshama (forgiveness) is the ability to pardon others' offenses without harboring resentment. Dhriti (fortitude) is the steadfastness to maintain one's spiritual practices and principles even in adversity. Shaucha (purity) encompasses both external cleanliness and internal purity of thought and intention.\n\nAdroha (absence of malice) indicates a heart free from the desire to harm others, even those who may have wronged us. Natimanita (freedom from excessive pride) is the absence of an inflated sense of self-importance, though it does not mean complete absence of self-respect. Together with the qualities mentioned in the previous verses, these attributes form the foundation of divine nature. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'Bharata' (descendant of Bharata), reminding him of his noble lineage and encouraging him to cultivate these divine qualities.\n\nThese divine qualities are not merely ethical guidelines but represent the natural expression of a spiritually evolved consciousness. One who possesses these attributes moves toward liberation (moksha), while their opposites lead to bondage. The verse emphasizes that these qualities 'belong to' (bhavanti) those born with divine endowments, suggesting both an innate tendency and the result of past karmic merit, though they can also be cultivated through sincere spiritual practice and self-effort.",
