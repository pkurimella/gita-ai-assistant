  "transliteration": "ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate |\niti matvā bhajante māṁ budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ ||",
  "translation": "I am the source of all creation; everything proceeds from Me. Understanding this, the wise worship Me with devotion and deep feeling.",
  "commentary": "This verse is one of the most fundamental declarations in the Bhagavad Gita, establishing Krishna's position as the ultimate source and origin of all existence. Krishna proclaims that He is the prabhava (source) of everything—all beings, all worlds, all cosmic manifestations emerge from Him. Furthermore, everything in creation operates and functions (pravartate) according to His will and energy. This is not merely a statement of power, but a revelation of the metaphysical reality underlying all existence.\n\nThe second half of the verse describes the response of the wise (budha) to this understanding. Those who truly comprehend this fundamental truth do not remain merely intellectual about it—they respond with bhakti (devotion) that is bhava-samanvita (endowed with deep spiritual emotion and love). This verse establishes the foundation for bhakti yoga by showing that true knowledge of Krishna's supreme position naturally leads to loving devotion. The wise recognize that if everything comes from the Divine and depends upon the Divine, then the most appropriate response is wholehearted worship and surrender.\n\nThis verse serves as the philosophical cornerstone of Chapter 10, which goes on to enumerate Krishna's various manifestations and glories. By establishing Himself as the ultimate source, Krishna provides the context for understanding why He can be recognized in the most excellent manifestations throughout creation. The verse also bridges jnana (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion), showing that true wisdom culminates in loving worship rather than dry intellectualism.",
