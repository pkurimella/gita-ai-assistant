  "translation": "As a lamp in a windless place does not flicker—this simile is used to describe the yogi of controlled mind, practicing the yoga of the Self.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most beautiful and memorable similes in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna compares the steady mind of an accomplished yogi to a lamp placed in a sheltered spot where no wind can disturb its flame. Just as such a lamp burns with an unwavering, steady light, the mind of a disciplined yogi remains completely still and focused during meditation on the Self (Atman). The absence of flickering represents the absence of mental modifications, distractions, and the restless movements of thought that ordinarily characterize the untrained mind.\n\nThis metaphor comes at a crucial point in Chapter 6, where Krishna has been describing the progressive stages and characteristics of meditation. The verse emphasizes the quality of ekāgratā (one-pointedness) that must be achieved through practice. The yogi whose mind has been brought under control (yata-citta) through disciplined practice experiences this steadiness naturally. The comparison to a windless environment suggests that the yogi has created internal conditions—through withdrawal from sense objects, proper posture, breath control, and mental discipline—where the mind can rest in its natural state of clarity and peace.\n\nThe philosophical significance of this verse extends beyond mere concentration technique. It points to the ultimate goal of yoga: the direct, unwavering experience of the Self. When the mind becomes perfectly still like the unflickering flame, it can reflect the light of consciousness without distortion. This state represents not suppression but transcendence of mental fluctuations, where the yogi abides in pure awareness. This simile has inspired countless practitioners throughout history and remains a touchstone for understanding the quality of mind required for Self-realization.",
