  "sanskrit": "ध्यानेनात्मनि पश्यन्ति केचिदात्मानमात्मना ।\nअन्ये सांख्येन योगेन कर्मयोगेन चापरे ॥",
  "transliteration": "dhyānenātmani paśyanti kecid ātmānam ātmanā |\nanye sāṅkhyena yogena karma-yogena cāpare ||",
  "translation": "Some perceive the Self in the self through meditation; others through the yoga of knowledge (Sankhya); and still others through the yoga of action (Karma Yoga).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes three primary paths by which seekers can realize the Supreme Self. The first path is through dhyana (meditation), where contemplatives directly perceive the Atman within themselves through sustained meditative practice. This represents the path of Raja Yoga or meditation yoga, where the mind is turned inward to experience one's true nature beyond the modifications of the mind.\n\nThe second path mentioned is Sankhya Yoga, the yoga of knowledge or discriminative wisdom, where practitioners use intellectual discernment to distinguish between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter), between the knower and the known, the eternal and the temporary. The third path is Karma Yoga, the yoga of selfless action, where individuals realize the Self through dedicated, desireless action performed as an offering to the Divine. This verse emphasizes the inclusive nature of spiritual practice, acknowledging that different temperaments and capacities require different approaches to the same ultimate truth.\n\nThis teaching is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 13, which deals with the distinction between the field (kshetra) and the knower of the field (kshetrajna). Krishna is showing that regardless of the path chosen, the goal remains the same: the realization of the true Self. This verse validates multiple spiritual approaches and demonstrates the universality of Vedantic wisdom, accommodating contemplatives, intellectuals, and active individuals alike in their journey toward self-realization.",
