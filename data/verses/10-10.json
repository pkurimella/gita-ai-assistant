  "commentary": "This verse reveals Krishna's divine grace toward sincere devotees. When devotees engage in constant devotion (satata-yukta) with genuine love and affection (prīti-pūrvakam), the Lord reciprocates by bestowing buddhi-yoga—the yoga of discriminative intelligence or divine wisdom. This is not ordinary intellectual knowledge but a special spiritual insight that enables the devotee to realize and attain the Supreme.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between the devotee and the Divine. While the devotee offers loving devotion, Krishna responds by granting the inner wisdom necessary for complete realization. This buddhi-yoga is the direct means (yena) by which devotees ultimately reach Krishna. It represents divine grace working through the intellect, purifying understanding and removing all obstacles to Self-realization. This teaching is central to the Bhakti tradition, showing that sincere devotion naturally culminates in wisdom and union with the Divine.",
