  "translation": "But one who moves among sense objects with senses under control, free from attraction and aversion, and who is self-disciplined, attains tranquility of mind.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents the positive alternative to the path of destruction described in the previous verses. Krishna explains that it is possible to engage with sense objects without falling into the trap of attachment and desire. The key lies in maintaining control over one's senses while remaining free from rāga (attraction) and dveṣa (aversion). This is the middle path between complete renunciation and uncontrolled indulgence.\n\nThe verse emphasizes three crucial qualities: freedom from likes and dislikes (rāga-dveṣa-viyukta), self-mastery over the senses (ātma-vaśya), and self-discipline (vidheya-ātmā). When one cultivates these qualities, one attains prasāda—a state of mental clarity, serenity, and grace. This tranquility is not achieved through avoiding the world, but through engaging with it from a place of inner stability and equanimity.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of karma yoga, where action is performed without attachment to results. It demonstrates that spiritual progress does not require withdrawal from life, but rather a transformation of one's relationship with sense experiences. The verse serves as a bridge between the warnings about desire-driven action and the description of the sthita-prajña (person of steady wisdom) that characterizes much of this chapter.",
