  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of Distinction between the Field and the Knower of the Field",
  "sanskrit": "इति क्षेत्रं तथा ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं चोक्तं समासतः।\nमद्भक्त एतद्विज्ञाय मद्भावायोपपद्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "iti kṣetraṁ tathā jñānaṁ jñeyaṁ coktaṁ samāsataḥ |\nmadbhakta etadvijñāya madbhāvāyopapadyate ||",
  "translation": "Thus the Field, Knowledge, and the Knowable have been briefly described. My devotee, understanding this, becomes fit to attain My nature.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as a concluding summary of the teachings presented thus far in Chapter 13. Krishna synthesizes the three fundamental topics He has expounded: kṣetra (the field of the body and nature), jñāna (the means of knowledge including the twenty virtues), and jñeya (the knowable, the Supreme Reality). The word 'samāsataḥ' indicates that these profound subjects have been presented in a concise manner, suggesting there are deeper dimensions yet to be explored.\n\nThe second line reveals the practical purpose of this knowledge. Krishna emphasizes that His devotee (madbhakta) who truly comprehends these three aspects becomes qualified to attain His divine nature (madbhāva). This is not mere intellectual understanding but a transformative realization that leads to spiritual evolution. The verse establishes that devotion combined with discriminative knowledge leads to the ultimate goal of God-realization.\n\nThis verse is significant as it bridges the descriptive teaching with its soteriological purpose. It demonstrates that the Gita's philosophy is not abstract metaphysics but a practical path to liberation. The emphasis on 'madbhakta' shows that devotion is the key that unlocks the transformative power of this knowledge, leading the aspirant from understanding to actual realization of the Divine nature.",
