  "sanskrit": "महात्मानस्तु मां पार्थ दैवीं प्रकृतिमाश्रिताः |\nभजन्त्यनन्यमनसो ज्ञात्वा भूतादिमव्ययम् ||",
  "transliteration": "mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ |\nbhajanty ananya-manaso jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam ||",
  "translation": "But the great souls, O Partha, taking refuge in the divine nature, worship Me with single-minded devotion, knowing Me as the imperishable origin of all beings.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna contrasts the mahātmās (great souls) with the deluded persons described in the previous verse. These noble beings have taken shelter of the daivī prakṛti (divine nature) rather than the āsurī prakṛti (demonic nature). Their distinguishing characteristic is ananya-manas—single-pointed, undivided devotion where the mind is fixed exclusively on the Supreme.\n\nThe great souls worship Krishna with full knowledge (jñātvā) that He is bhūtādim—the primordial source and origin of all beings—and avyayam—imperishable and unchanging. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential, arising from their divine nature. Unlike those who worship demigods for temporary gains, these mahātmās recognize the eternal, ultimate reality and dedicate themselves completely to it. Their devotion is characterized by both knowledge and love, understanding Krishna's true nature as the Supreme Being while simultaneously engaging in loving service.\n\nThis verse establishes the ideal of bhakti (devotion) combined with jñāna (knowledge). The great souls are not swayed by material desires or temporary benefits. Their refuge in divine nature protects them from delusion and enables them to perceive the ultimate truth. This represents the highest form of spiritual practice described in this chapter—exclusive devotion born of divine qualities and true understanding of the Supreme's position as the source and sustainer of all existence.",
