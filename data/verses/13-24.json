  "chapterMeaning": "The Yoga of the Distinction between the Field and the Knower of the Field",
  "sanskrit": "य एवं वेत्ति पुरुषं प्रकृतिं च गुणैः सह ।\nसर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि न स भूयोऽभिजायते ॥२४॥",
  "transliteration": "ya evaṁ vetti puruṣaṁ prakṛtiṁ ca guṇaiḥ saha |\nsarvathā vartamāno'pi na sa bhūyo'bhijāyate ||24||",
  "translation": "One who thus knows the Purusha (Self) and Prakriti (Nature) along with the gunas (qualities), even though engaged in all kinds of activities, is not born again.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents the liberating knowledge that comes from understanding the distinction between the eternal Self (Purusha) and material nature (Prakriti) with its three gunas. Krishna declares that one who truly comprehends this fundamental distinction attains liberation from the cycle of birth and death. The phrase 'sarvathā vartamānaḥ api' (even though engaged in all kinds of activities) is particularly significant—it indicates that liberation is not dependent on renunciation of action, but on the wisdom of discrimination between the Self and nature.\n\nThis verse synthesizes the teachings of the entire chapter by showing that knowledge of the field (kṣetra) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña) leads to moksha. The person who realizes that the true Self is distinct from the body-mind complex and its activities, and understands how the gunas operate through Prakriti, remains untouched by karma. Such a person lives in the world but is not bound by it, performing actions without creating new karmic impressions that would necessitate rebirth. This represents the culmination of jñāna yoga—the path of knowledge—where discriminative wisdom itself becomes the means of liberation, regardless of one's external circumstances or activities.",
