  "translation": "The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be its seat. Through these, desire deludes the embodied soul by veiling its wisdom.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna identifies the specific locations or instruments through which desire (kama) operates to delude human beings. The three seats of desire are the senses (indriyani), the mind (manas), and the intellect (buddhi). These represent the progressive levels of human consciousness - from the gross sensory level to the subtle intellectual level. Desire establishes itself in these faculties and uses them as its base of operations to control and confuse the individual soul.\n\nThe verse explains the mechanism of delusion: desire covers or veils (avritya) the inherent knowledge (jnana) of the embodied soul (dehinam). This is significant because it suggests that wisdom is not something to be acquired from outside but is already present within, merely covered by desire. When desire operates through the senses, mind, and intellect, it creates a fog of confusion that prevents the soul from recognizing its true nature and acting according to dharma. This verse sets up the following verses where Krishna will prescribe the method to overcome this enemy by controlling these very instruments that desire uses as its stronghold.",
