  "translation": "O Partha (Arjuna), how can one who knows the Self to be indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable—how can such a person slay anyone or cause anyone to slay?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his discourse on the eternal nature of the Self (Atman) and its implications for action. He poses a rhetorical question to Arjuna: if one truly understands that the Self is indestructible (avināśin), eternal (nitya), unborn (aja), and immutable (avyaya), then how can such a person be considered a killer or cause killing? The verse addresses Arjuna's moral dilemma about fighting in battle by pointing to a deeper metaphysical reality—that the true Self cannot be killed or cause killing, as it transcends physical action.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Sāṅkhya philosophy presented in this chapter, which distinguishes between the eternal, unchanging Self and the temporary, changing body. Krishna is not advocating violence but rather explaining that one who has realized the true nature of the Self understands that birth and death apply only to the physical body, not to the eternal consciousness within. The verse challenges conventional notions of agency and action, suggesting that true knowledge transforms one's understanding of what it means to act in the world.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in establishing the foundation for karma yoga—action without attachment. By understanding that the Self is beyond destruction, one can perform one's duty without being bound by the fruits of action or paralyzed by moral confusion. This verse thus serves as a bridge between the metaphysical teachings about the Self and the practical guidance on righteous action that Krishna will elaborate upon in subsequent verses.",
