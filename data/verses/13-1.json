  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Keshava, I wish to understand Prakriti (Nature) and Purusha (Spirit), the field (Kshetra) and the knower of the field (Kshetrajna), as well as knowledge (Jnana) and that which is to be known (Jneya).",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of Chapter 13, which is considered one of the most philosophically profound chapters of the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna poses a comprehensive question to Krishna, seeking clarification on fundamental metaphysical concepts that form the basis of Vedantic philosophy. He asks about six key concepts: Prakriti (material nature), Purusha (the conscious principle), Kshetra (the field of activity, referring to the body-mind complex), Kshetrajna (the knower of the field, the conscious Self), Jnana (true knowledge), and Jneya (the object of knowledge).\n\nThis inquiry demonstrates Arjuna's spiritual evolution from a confused warrior in the first chapter to a sincere seeker of ultimate truth. The question sets the stage for Krishna's detailed exposition on the distinction between matter and spirit, body and soul, the changing and the unchanging. Understanding this distinction is crucial for spiritual liberation, as it enables one to discriminate between the eternal Self and the temporary material manifestations. The chapter addresses the fundamental dualism that must be understood and transcended on the path to self-realization.\n\nThe verse also establishes the pedagogical structure of the chapter, where Krishna will systematically explain each of these concepts, ultimately revealing that true knowledge lies in understanding the relationship between the field (the body and material nature) and its knower (the immortal Self or Atman). This knowledge forms the foundation for discriminative wisdom (viveka) that leads to moksha (liberation).",
