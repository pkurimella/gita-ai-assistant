  "commentary": "This verse continues Krishna's description of the qualities of an advanced yogi, emphasizing the supreme virtue of equanimity (sama-buddhi). Krishna presents a comprehensive list of different types of people one encounters in life—from well-wishers and friends to enemies and the hateful, from the righteous to the sinful. The yogi who has truly mastered the mind sees all these with equal vision, transcending personal likes and dislikes, attractions and aversions.\n\nThis equanimity does not mean indifference or lack of appropriate action in different situations. Rather, it signifies an inner state where one's essential peace and spiritual vision remain undisturbed by external relationships and the behavior of others. The yogi recognizes the divine presence in all beings, understanding that all are souls on their own evolutionary journey. This verse builds upon the previous descriptions of the steady-minded yogi, showing that true spiritual advancement manifests as universal compassion and equal-mindedness.\n\nThe word 'viśiṣyate' (excels) indicates that such equanimity represents the pinnacle of yogic achievement. This quality is essential for meditation because mental disturbances caused by attraction and aversion are major obstacles to inner peace. By cultivating sama-buddhi toward all categories of people, the yogi purifies the mind and creates the optimal conditions for deep meditation and self-realization.",
