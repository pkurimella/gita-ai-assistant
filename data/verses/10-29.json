  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations across various categories of beings. Ananta (also known as Shesha) is the infinite cosmic serpent upon whom Lord Vishnu reclines, representing the supreme among all serpent beings. Varuna is the ancient Vedic deity presiding over the cosmic waters and oceans, symbolizing the vastness and depth of aquatic realms. These manifestations represent Krishna's presence in the most prominent and powerful forms within each category.\n\nThe reference to Aryama among the Pitris (ancestors) is significant in Vedic cosmology, as Aryama is considered the chief among the ancestral deities who receive offerings during shraddha ceremonies. Yama, the god of death and dharma, represents Krishna among those who regulate and maintain cosmic order (samyamata). Yama's role as the impartial judge who ensures that every being faces the consequences of their actions reflects the divine principle of justice and regulation. This verse emphasizes that wherever there is excellence, power, or authority in maintaining cosmic order, that manifestation is a reflection of Krishna's divine presence, reminding seekers that the Supreme pervades all levels of existence from the celestial to the ancestral realms.",
