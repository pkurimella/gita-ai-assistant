  "commentary": "This verse describes the technical yogic process for achieving the state of consciousness necessary for remembering the Supreme at the time of death. Krishna outlines a systematic method involving three key steps: first, withdrawing the senses from their external objects (pratyahara); second, concentrating the mind in the heart center; and third, drawing the prana (life-force) upward to the crown of the head (sahasrara chakra). This represents the classical practice of kundalini yoga where the vital energy is channeled through the sushumna nadi to the highest chakra.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of complete sensory withdrawal and mental discipline. By closing all the 'gates' (the sense organs), the practitioner prevents the dissipation of consciousness through external stimuli. The heart is mentioned as the seat where the mind should be fixed, as it is considered the central location of consciousness in yogic physiology. The culmination of this practice involves raising the prana to the crown of the head, which is the exit point for the soul of an enlightened yogi at death. This technique is part of the larger instruction Krishna is giving about how to attain Him at the moment of death, which is the central theme of this chapter on the imperishable Brahman.",
