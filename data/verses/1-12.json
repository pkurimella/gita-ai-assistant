  "sanskrit": "तस्य सञ्जनयन्हर्षं कुरुवृद्धः पितामहः।\nसिंहनादं विनद्योच्चैः शङ्खं दध्मौ प्रतापवान्॥",
  "transliteration": "tasya sañjanayan harṣaṁ kuru-vṛddhaḥ pitāmahaḥ |\nsiṁha-nādaṁ vinadyoccaiḥ śaṅkhaṁ dadhmau pratāpavān ||",
  "translation": "Then, generating joy in him (Duryodhana), the aged grandfather of the Kurus, the glorious Bhishma, blew his conch shell loudly, producing a sound like a lion's roar.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a pivotal moment in the pre-battle atmosphere. Bhishma, the grand patriarch of the Kuru dynasty and the supreme commander of the Kaurava army, perceives Duryodhana's anxiety after his assessment of both armies. To boost the morale of his grandson and dispel any doubts, Bhishma sounds his conch shell with a thunderous lion-like roar. This act serves multiple purposes: it reassures Duryodhana, signals the readiness of the Kaurava forces, and demonstrates the unwavering commitment of their most respected warrior.\n\nThe comparison of Bhishma's conch sound to a lion's roar (simha-nada) is significant, symbolizing power, fearlessness, and dominance. Bhishma, despite his personal affection for the Pandavas and his knowledge of dharma, stands bound by his oath of loyalty to the throne of Hastinapura. This verse illustrates the tragic dimension of the Mahabharata war, where even the noblest warriors find themselves on opposing sides due to complex obligations and loyalties. The sounding of the conch also serves as a formal declaration that the battle is about to commence, setting in motion the events that will lead to Arjuna's moral crisis and Krishna's timeless teachings.",
