  "translation": "Thus knowing the Self to be superior to the intellect, and restraining the mind by the Self, O mighty-armed Arjuna, destroy this enemy in the form of desire, which is so difficult to conquer.",
  "commentary": "This concluding verse of Chapter 3 provides the practical solution to overcoming desire (kama), which Krishna has identified as the great enemy of spiritual progress. Krishna instructs Arjuna to recognize the hierarchical nature of human consciousness: the senses are superior to inert matter, the mind is superior to the senses, the intellect (buddhi) is superior to the mind, and the Self (Atman) is superior to even the intellect. By establishing oneself in this highest awareness of the Self, one gains the strength to control the lower faculties.\n\nThe verse emphasizes self-effort and self-mastery - 'restraining the mind by the Self' (saṁstabhyātmānam ātmanā) indicates that the power to overcome desire lies within oneself. Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'mighty-armed' (mahābāho), reminding him of his warrior strength, but directing that strength inward toward the conquest of the internal enemy rather than external foes. The term 'durāsadam' (difficult to conquer) acknowledges the formidable nature of desire, yet the verse conveys confidence that through self-knowledge and self-control, victory is achievable. This verse synthesizes the chapter's teaching on Karma Yoga by showing that right action flows naturally from one who has conquered desire through establishment in Self-knowledge.",
