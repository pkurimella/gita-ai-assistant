  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's enumeration of the twenty virtues or qualities (jñāna) that constitute true knowledge and lead to Self-realization. These are not merely intellectual accomplishments but moral and spiritual qualities that purify the mind and prepare it for higher wisdom. The verse lists eight qualities: humility (freedom from pride), unpretentiousness (absence of hypocrisy), non-violence in thought, word and deed, forgiveness toward those who wrong us, straightforwardness in conduct, devoted service to one's spiritual teacher, both external and internal purity, steadfastness in spiritual practice, and control over the mind and senses.\n\nThese virtues are presented as prerequisites for understanding the distinction between kṣetra (the field of matter) and kṣetrajña (the knower, the Self). Krishna emphasizes that without cultivating these qualities, mere intellectual study cannot lead to true knowledge. The list continues in the following verses, ultimately comprising twenty attributes. In the context of this chapter, these qualities prepare the seeker to discriminate between the perishable body-mind complex and the imperishable Self, which is the central teaching of this chapter. They represent the ethical foundation upon which the edifice of spiritual knowledge must be built.",
