  "transliteration": "yaḥ sarvatrānabhisnehas tat tat prāpya śubhāśubham | nābhinandati na dveṣṭi tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā ||",
  "translation": "One who is without attachment everywhere, who neither rejoices upon obtaining good nor grieves upon obtaining evil—that person's wisdom is firmly established.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues his description of the sthitaprajña (person of steady wisdom) by emphasizing the quality of non-attachment. The key characteristic is being 'anabhisneha' (without attachment) in all situations. This does not mean indifference or apathy, but rather a state of inner equilibrium that is not disturbed by external circumstances. When pleasant or unpleasant events occur, such a person neither becomes elated nor dejected, maintaining perfect equanimity.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Sāṅkhya Yoga philosophy presented in this chapter. Krishna is explaining that true wisdom is not merely intellectual understanding, but a lived reality that manifests as emotional stability. The person of steady wisdom has transcended the pairs of opposites (dvandva) - pleasure and pain, success and failure, praise and blame. This state is achieved through discrimination (viveka) between the eternal Self and the temporary modifications of nature.\n\nThe verse has profound practical implications for spiritual seekers. It suggests that the test of one's spiritual progress is not in how well one performs in meditation or ritual, but in how one responds to life's inevitable ups and downs. The ability to remain centered regardless of circumstances indicates that one's wisdom (prajñā) has become firmly established (pratiṣṭhitā), rooted in the unchanging Self rather than in the changing world of objects and experiences.",
