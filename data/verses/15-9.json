  "commentary": "This verse describes how the individual soul (jīva) functions through the physical body by utilizing the five sense organs and the mind. Krishna explains that the soul, while inhabiting the body, presides over (adhiṣṭhāya) these instruments of perception—hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell—along with the coordinating faculty of the mind. Through these instruments, the soul experiences the sense objects of the material world. The term 'upasevate' indicates that the soul actively engages with and enjoys these sensory experiences.\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding the relationship between the eternal soul and the temporary body. Krishna is illustrating that while the soul is distinct from the senses and mind, it operates through them during embodiment. The soul is the conscious principle that animates these otherwise inert instruments, making sensory experience possible. This understanding is essential for spiritual practice, as it helps the seeker distinguish between the true self (ātman) and the instruments through which it operates. The verse also sets up the following discussion about how the soul transmigrates, carrying these subtle impressions and tendencies from one body to another, a process visible only to those with the eye of knowledge.",
