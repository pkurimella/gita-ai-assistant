  "translation": "Indeed, King Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone. Even for the sake of guiding people on the right path, you should perform your duty.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides historical precedent for the path of selfless action by citing the example of King Janaka and other enlightened rulers who achieved spiritual perfection while actively engaged in their worldly duties. Janaka, the father of Sita and a renowned philosopher-king, is held up as the ideal karma yogi who maintained inner detachment while fulfilling his royal responsibilities. This demonstrates that renunciation of action is not necessary for spiritual realization; rather, one can attain the highest state through dedicated performance of one's duties without attachment to results.\n\nKrishna introduces a second important reason for Arjuna to engage in action: lokasaṅgraha, or the welfare and guidance of society. Great souls and leaders have a responsibility to set an example for others through their conduct. If someone of Arjuna's stature were to abandon his duties, it would send a harmful message to society and potentially lead others astray. This concept of leading by example is crucial in the Gita's teaching on dharma. The verse thus establishes both personal perfection and social responsibility as valid reasons for engaging in prescribed action, bridging individual spiritual development with collective welfare.",
