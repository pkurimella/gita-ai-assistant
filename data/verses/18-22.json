  "transliteration": "yat tu kṛtsnavad ekasmin kārye saktam ahaitukam|\natattvārthavad alpaṁ ca tat tāmasam udāhṛtam||",
  "translation": "But that knowledge which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without concern for the cause, without grasping the true reality, and which is trivial—that is declared to be tamasic (born of darkness).",
  "commentary": "This verse completes Krishna's classification of knowledge according to the three gunas by describing tamasic knowledge. Such knowledge is characterized by extreme narrowness and attachment to a single object or activity as if it were everything. It lacks rational foundation (ahaitukam), being without proper reasoning or understanding of causes. This type of knowledge fails to comprehend the true nature of reality (atattvārthavat) and remains superficial and insignificant (alpam).\n\nTamasic knowledge represents the lowest form of understanding, where one becomes obsessively fixated on a limited aspect of reality while mistaking it for the complete truth. This could manifest as dogmatic adherence to rituals without understanding their purpose, or attachment to material objects while ignoring spiritual dimensions. Such knowledge keeps one bound in ignorance and delusion, preventing any real progress toward liberation. In the context of Chapter 18's theme of renunciation and liberation, Krishna emphasizes that true freedom requires transcending this limited, darkness-bound understanding and cultivating sattvic knowledge that perceives the unity underlying all diversity.",
