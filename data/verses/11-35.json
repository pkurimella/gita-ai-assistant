  "sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच।\nएतच्छ्रुत्वा वचनं केशवस्य कृताञ्जलिर्वेपमानः किरीटी।\nनमस्कृत्वा भूय एवाह कृष्णं सगद्गदं भीतभीतः प्रणम्य॥",
  "transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\netac chrutvā vacanaṁ keśavasya kṛtāñjalir vepamānaḥ kirīṭī\nnamaskṛtvā bhūya evāha kṛṣṇaṁ sagadgadaṁ bhītabhītaḥ praṇamya",
  "translation": "Sanjaya said: Having heard this speech of Keshava (Krishna), the crowned one (Arjuna), with joined palms and trembling, bowing down again, prostrating with great fear, spoke to Krishna in a choked voice.",
  "commentary": "This verse marks a transition in Chapter 11, as Sanjaya, the narrator, describes Arjuna's overwhelmed state after witnessing the cosmic form of the Lord. Arjuna is depicted as trembling (vepamāna), with hands folded in reverence (kṛtāñjali), and speaking in a faltering voice choked with emotion (sagadgada). The repetition of 'bhīta' (frightened) emphasizes his profound terror and awe at the magnificent and terrifying vision he has just witnessed.\n\nThe verse captures the human response to the divine revelation. Despite being a great warrior, Arjuna is reduced to a state of reverent fear before the cosmic manifestation. His physical reactions—trembling, prostrating repeatedly, and speaking with difficulty—demonstrate that the vision of the Universal Form has completely overwhelmed his ordinary consciousness. This sets the stage for Arjuna's subsequent prayers and requests to Krishna, showing how even the most intimate devotee is awestruck by the full glory of the Divine. The verse also reminds readers that this entire dialogue is being narrated by Sanjaya to the blind king Dhritarashtra, maintaining the narrative framework of the Gita.",
