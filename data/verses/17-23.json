  "sanskrit": "ॐ तत्सदिति निर्देशो ब्रह्मणस्त्रिविधः स्मृतः।\nब्राह्मणास्तेन वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च विहिताः पुरा॥",
  "transliteration": "oṁ tat sad iti nirdeśo brahmaṇas trividhaḥ smṛtaḥ |\nbrāhmaṇās tena vedāś ca yajñāś ca vihitāḥ purā ||",
  "translation": "OM TAT SAT—this has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By this were created in ancient times the Brahmanas, the Vedas, and the sacrifices.",
  "commentary": "This verse introduces the sacred syllables OM TAT SAT, which represent the threefold designation of the Absolute Reality (Brahman). These three words are not merely sounds but profound indicators of the Supreme Truth. OM represents the imperishable Brahman and is the primordial sound from which all creation emanates. TAT (That) indicates the transcendent, unmanifest aspect of the Divine beyond all attributes. SAT (Existence/Truth) denotes the eternal, unchanging reality that underlies all manifestation.\n\nKrishna explains that these sacred designations were established at the beginning of creation and formed the foundation for the spiritual tradition. The Brahmanas (the priestly class and spiritual teachers), the Vedas (sacred scriptures), and yajñas (sacrificial rituals) were all instituted with these sacred syllables as their basis. This verse establishes the divine origin and authority of the Vedic tradition, showing that spiritual practices are not human inventions but divinely ordained means for realizing the Supreme.\n\nThe philosophical significance lies in understanding that these three terms together encompass the complete nature of Ultimate Reality—OM as the cosmic sound-form, TAT as the transcendent aspect beyond comprehension, and SAT as the eternal existence. When spiritual seekers invoke these designations in their practices of charity, austerity, and sacrifice (as explained in subsequent verses), they align their actions with the highest truth and dedicate them to Brahman rather than performing them for selfish gains.",
