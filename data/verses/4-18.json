  "translation": "One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is truly wise among humans; such a person is a yogi and has accomplished all actions.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents one of the most profound paradoxes in the Bhagavad Gita regarding the nature of action and inaction. Krishna teaches that true wisdom lies in perceiving the deeper reality beyond apparent activity. To see 'inaction in action' means to recognize that when one acts without ego, attachment, or desire for results, the Self (Atman) remains untouched and inactive even while the body performs actions. Conversely, to see 'action in inaction' means understanding that even apparent physical stillness involves mental activity and karmic consequences if accompanied by desire, aversion, or delusion.\n\nThis teaching directly addresses the central dilemma of the Gita - how to act in the world while remaining spiritually free. The truly wise person (buddhimān) understands that actions performed with complete detachment, in the spirit of yajna (sacrifice), and with knowledge of the Self do not bind one to karmic consequences. Such a person is called 'yukta' (united or yoked), meaning established in yoga, and is considered to have accomplished all actions (kṛtsna-karma-kṛt) because their actions are complete and perfect, leaving no karmic residue.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding karma yoga as taught in the Gita. It establishes that the quality of consciousness during action, rather than the action itself, determines whether one accumulates karma or remains free. This wisdom enables one to fulfill all worldly duties while simultaneously progressing toward liberation, resolving the apparent conflict between action and renunciation that forms the foundation of this chapter.",
