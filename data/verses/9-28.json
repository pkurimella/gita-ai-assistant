  "translation": "Thus you shall be freed from the bondage of actions yielding good and evil results. With your mind established in the yoga of renunciation, liberated, you shall come to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna assures Arjuna of the ultimate fruit of practicing karma yoga with complete surrender. By offering all actions and their results to the Divine, one transcends the binding nature of karma. The verse emphasizes that actions normally bind us through their pleasant and unpleasant consequences, creating chains of desire and aversion. However, when performed with the attitude of offering everything to God, these same actions become means of liberation rather than bondage.\n\nThe term 'sannyāsa-yoga' here refers not to physical renunciation but to the yoga of inner renunciation—the attitude of non-attachment while performing one's duties. This is the essence of karma yoga taught throughout the Gita. When the mind is established in this yoga of renunciation, one becomes 'vimukta' (liberated) even while living and acting in the world. This liberation is not postponed to after death but is a present reality for one who has truly surrendered.\n\nThe promise 'mām upaiṣyasi' (you shall come to Me) represents the culmination of the spiritual path. This verse beautifully integrates the themes of Chapter 9: devotion, surrender, and the liberating knowledge of God's true nature. It demonstrates that the path of devotion combined with selfless action leads inevitably to union with the Supreme, transcending the cycle of karma and rebirth.",
