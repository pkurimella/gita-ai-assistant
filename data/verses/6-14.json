  "translation": "With a serene mind, free from fear, established in the vow of celibacy, controlling the mind and fixing it on Me, the yogi should sit in meditation, absorbed in Me as the Supreme Goal.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His detailed instructions on the practice of meditation, now focusing on the mental and spiritual prerequisites. The yogi must cultivate a peaceful mind (praśāntātmā) that is free from fear and anxiety. The reference to brahmacharya (celibacy or continence) indicates the need for conservation and proper channeling of vital energies toward spiritual realization. This doesn't merely mean physical celibacy but also mental restraint and control over sensory impulses.\n\nThe verse emphasizes three crucial elements: mental tranquility, self-control, and devotional focus. The practitioner must restrain the mind (manaḥ saṃyamya) and direct all consciousness toward the Divine (mac-cittaḥ). This represents the culmination of the preparatory practices described in previous verses - proper posture, breath control, and sensory withdrawal now lead to complete absorption in the Supreme. The phrase 'mat-paraḥ' (having Me as the Supreme Goal) reveals that true yoga is not merely a mechanical practice but a devotional discipline where the ultimate aim is union with the Divine. This verse bridges the technical aspects of meditation with its spiritual purpose, showing that physical discipline must be accompanied by mental purity and devotional surrender to achieve the highest state of yoga.",
