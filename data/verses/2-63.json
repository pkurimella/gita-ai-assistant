  "translation": "From anger arises delusion; from delusion, confusion of memory; from confusion of memory, loss of discrimination; and from loss of discrimination, one perishes completely.",
  "commentary": "This verse completes the famous sequence of spiritual downfall that Krishna began in verse 62. It traces the devastating progression from anger to complete destruction. When anger arises, it clouds one's judgment and creates delusion (sammoha), preventing clear perception of reality. This delusion then causes confusion of memory (smṛti-vibhrama), where one forgets the discrimination between right and wrong, beneficial and harmful, eternal and temporary.\n\nWhen memory becomes confused, the faculty of discrimination (buddhi) is destroyed. This buddhi is the higher intellect that enables humans to distinguish between the Self and non-Self, the permanent and impermanent. It is the very instrument of spiritual wisdom and ethical decision-making. When this faculty is lost, a person loses their essential human capacity for wise judgment and self-control.\n\nThe final consequence is complete ruin (praṇaśyati) - the total destruction of one's spiritual, moral, and often material well-being. This verse serves as a powerful warning within the larger context of Chapter 2, where Krishna is teaching Arjuna about self-control, equanimity, and the steady wisdom of the sthitaprajña. It demonstrates why sense control and emotional regulation are not mere moral suggestions but essential practices for spiritual survival and growth. The verse emphasizes that spiritual destruction is not sudden but occurs through a chain of mental states, each leading inexorably to the next.",
