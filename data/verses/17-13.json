  "sanskrit": "विधिहीनमसृष्टान्नं मन्त्रहीनमदक्षिणम्।\nश्रद्धाविरहितं यज्ञं तामसं परिचक्षते॥",
  "transliteration": "vidhi-hīnam asṛṣṭānnaṁ mantra-hīnam adakṣiṇam |\nśraddhā-virahitaṁ yajñaṁ tāmasaṁ paricakṣate ||",
  "translation": "A sacrifice that is performed without following scriptural injunctions, without distributing food, without sacred mantras, without proper gifts to priests, and without faith—such a sacrifice is said to be tamasic (in the mode of ignorance).",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of tamasic or ignorant sacrifice, completing the threefold classification of yajna (sacrifice) according to the three gunas. Krishna identifies four major deficiencies that characterize a tamasic sacrifice: absence of proper scriptural procedure (vidhi-hīna), lack of food distribution to participants (asṛṣṭānna), omission of sacred mantras (mantra-hīna), and failure to give proper dakshina or gifts to the officiating priests (adakṣiṇa). Most critically, such a sacrifice is performed without genuine faith (śraddhā-virahita).\n\nThe absence of these essential elements indicates that the sacrifice is performed mechanically, without understanding, devotion, or proper intent. Such ritualistic actions, devoid of spiritual substance, cannot produce beneficial results and may even generate negative karma. This verse emphasizes that mere external performance of religious rites is insufficient; the inner attitude of faith and adherence to proper procedures are equally important. In the broader context of Chapter 17, which explores how faith manifests according to one's nature, this verse shows how tamasic faith leads to distorted and ineffective spiritual practices that lack both proper form and genuine devotion.",
