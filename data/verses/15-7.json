  "transliteration": "mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ |\nmanaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati ||",
  "translation": "An eternal fragment of Myself becomes the living being in the world of the living, drawing to itself the six senses, including the mind, which rest in material nature.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna reveals the true nature of the individual soul (jīva). He declares that every living being is an eternal fragment (sanātana aṁśa) of the Supreme Divine. This establishes the fundamental relationship between the individual soul and God - not one of complete identity, but of part and whole. The soul is qualitatively one with the Divine but quantitatively different, maintaining its individual existence eternally.\n\nThe verse describes the predicament of the embodied soul, which must struggle (karṣati - literally 'draws' or 'drags with effort') with the mind and the five senses while dwelling in material nature (prakṛti). The mind is counted as the sixth sense here, being the coordinating principle of the five physical senses. This struggle represents the soul's entanglement in material existence, where it must constantly engage with sensory experiences and mental modifications while its true nature remains divine and eternal.\n\nThis teaching is central to understanding the Gita's philosophy of the relationship between the individual and the Supreme. It refutes both absolute monism (which denies individual existence) and complete dualism (which denies the essential unity). The soul's eternal nature means that liberation is not about becoming divine but recognizing one's inherent divine nature while transcending identification with the material instruments of mind and senses.",
