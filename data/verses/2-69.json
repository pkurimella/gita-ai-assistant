  "sanskrit": "या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी ।\nयस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः ॥",
  "transliteration": "yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī |\nyasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni sā niśā paśyato muneḥ ||",
  "translation": "That which is night for all beings, in that the self-controlled person is awake; and where all beings are awake, that is night for the sage who sees.",
  "commentary": "This verse presents a profound paradox that illustrates the fundamental difference between the perspective of the enlightened sage and that of ordinary worldly people. What Krishna describes as 'night' represents a state of ignorance or unawareness. For most people, spiritual reality—the eternal nature of the Self, the impermanence of material existence, and the ultimate truth of Brahman—remains in darkness, like night. They are asleep to these truths. However, the self-controlled sage (saṁyamī) is fully awake and aware in this spiritual dimension, perceiving the eternal reality clearly.\n\nConversely, what occupies the waking attention of ordinary beings—sensory pleasures, material pursuits, worldly attachments, and the endless cycle of desires—is like night for the enlightened sage. The sage has transcended these concerns and sees them as illusory and temporary, having no real interest or investment in them. This verse emphasizes the complete reversal of values and perception that occurs with spiritual awakening. The muni (sage) lives in a different reality, one oriented toward the eternal rather than the temporal.\n\nThis teaching is central to the Sānkhya Yoga chapter's theme of discrimination between the real and unreal, the eternal and temporary. It reinforces Krishna's earlier teachings about equanimity, detachment, and the importance of transcending dualities. The verse serves as a marker of spiritual progress—the aspirant must gradually awaken to spiritual truths while becoming increasingly detached from purely material concerns.",
