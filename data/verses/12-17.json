  "sanskrit": "यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ्क्षति |\nशुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्यः स मे प्रियः ||१७||",
  "transliteration": "yo na hṛṣyati na dveṣṭi na śocati na kāṅkṣati |\nśubhāśubhaparityāgī bhaktimān yaḥ sa me priyaḥ ||17||",
  "translation": "One who neither rejoices nor hates, neither grieves nor desires, who has renounced both good and evil, and who is full of devotion—such a person is dear to Me.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the emotional equanimity of a true devotee. The ideal bhakta maintains perfect balance in all circumstances, neither becoming elated by pleasant experiences nor developing hatred toward unpleasant ones, neither lamenting losses nor craving gains. This fourfold negation (na hṛṣyati, na dveṣṭi, na śocati, na kāṅkṣati) represents complete freedom from the pairs of opposites that bind ordinary consciousness.\n\nThe phrase 'śubhāśubhaparityāgī' is particularly significant, indicating one who has transcended attachment to both auspicious and inauspicious results of actions. This doesn't mean abandoning righteous action, but rather performing one's duty without attachment to outcomes, whether they appear favorable or unfavorable. Such renunciation is internal rather than external—it is a renunciation of the fruits of action and the emotional reactions they typically generate.\n\nThis verse continues the theme of Chapter 12, which emphasizes that true devotion manifests not merely in ritual worship but in a transformed consciousness characterized by equanimity, detachment, and unwavering focus on the Divine. The devotee described here has achieved a state where personal preferences and aversions no longer disturb the mind, allowing uninterrupted communion with the Supreme. Such a person naturally becomes dear to Krishna because their consciousness has become aligned with the transcendent reality beyond dualities.",
