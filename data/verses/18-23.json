  "translation": "Action that is ordained, performed without attachment, without love or hatred, by one who does not desire the fruit—that action is said to be in the mode of goodness (sattva).",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna begins his analysis of the three types of action according to the three gunas (modes of material nature). Sattvic or pure action is characterized by five essential qualities: it is niyata (prescribed by scriptures or duty), performed without attachment (sanga-rahitam), executed without personal likes or dislikes (araga-dveshatah), done without desire for results (aphala-prepsuna), and carried out with equanimity. This represents the highest form of karma yoga, where action becomes a means of purification rather than bondage.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 18, which synthesizes the teachings of the entire Gita. Krishna is providing Arjuna with practical criteria to evaluate the quality of actions. Sattvic action aligns with dharma and leads to spiritual progress because it is performed as an offering to the Divine, free from the ego's demands for personal gain. Such action does not create new karmic bonds but instead purifies the mind and prepares it for higher knowledge.\n\nThe philosophical importance of this teaching lies in its practical application of the guna theory to daily life. By understanding what constitutes sattvic action, a spiritual aspirant can consciously choose to act in ways that elevate consciousness rather than binding it to material existence. This verse establishes the gold standard for karma yoga—performing one's duty with complete detachment and dedication to the higher purpose.",
