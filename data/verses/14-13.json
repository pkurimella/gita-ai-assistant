  "sanskrit": "अप्रकाशोऽप्रवृत्तिश्च प्रमादो मोह एव च |\nतमस्येतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे कुरुनन्दन ॥१३॥",
  "transliteration": "aprakāśo'pravṛttiśca pramādo moha eva ca |\ntamasyetāni jāyante vivṛddhe kurunandana ||13||",
  "translation": "Darkness, inactivity, heedlessness, and delusion—these arise when tamas predominates, O descendant of Kuru.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the specific manifestations that appear when the mode of tamas (darkness or ignorance) becomes predominant in a person. The four characteristics mentioned—aprakāśa (absence of light or discrimination), apravṛtti (lack of activity or initiative), pramāda (heedlessness or negligence), and moha (delusion or bewilderment)—represent the complete spectrum of tamasic influence on human consciousness and behavior. When tamas increases, the intellect becomes clouded, preventing clear understanding and proper judgment. This leads to inertia where even necessary actions are not performed, carelessness in duties, and a fundamental confusion about what is real and what is illusory.\n\nThis verse completes the triad of descriptions begun in verses 11 and 12, where Krishna outlined the signs of sattva and rajas respectively. The progression shows how each guna creates a distinct psychological and behavioral pattern. While sattva brings illumination and rajas brings passionate activity, tamas brings the opposite—darkness and inactivity. The address 'Kurunandana' (joy of the Kurus) serves as a reminder to Arjuna of his noble heritage and the importance of recognizing and transcending these lower qualities. Understanding these signs is crucial for spiritual practitioners, as it enables them to identify which guna is predominating at any given time and take appropriate measures to cultivate sattva and ultimately transcend all three gunas.",
