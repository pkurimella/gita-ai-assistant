  "translation": "When a person contemplates sense objects, attachment to them develops. From attachment arises desire, and from desire anger is born.",
  "commentary": "This verse begins Krishna's famous teaching on the downward spiral of consciousness that leads to a person's complete destruction. It describes the psychological progression that occurs when one dwells upon sense objects. The process starts innocuously with mere contemplation (dhyāyataḥ) of sensory experiences, which gradually develops into attachment (saṅga). This attachment is not merely casual interest but a binding connection that creates dependency.\n\nThe verse then traces how attachment inevitably gives birth to desire or craving (kāma) - the intense longing to possess or experience the object of attachment. When this desire is obstructed or unfulfilled, it transforms into anger (krodha). This sequence reveals the mechanical nature of the untrained mind and how it becomes enslaved by its own thought patterns. Krishna is teaching Arjuna about the importance of controlling the mind's tendency to dwell on sense objects, as this is the root cause of bondage.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in the context of Chapter 2, where Krishna is establishing the foundation of spiritual wisdom. It serves as a warning about the dangers of uncontrolled sensory engagement and sets up the subsequent verses that describe the complete destruction that follows this path. The teaching emphasizes that spiritual downfall begins not with gross actions but with subtle mental processes - the dwelling of the mind on sense objects.",
