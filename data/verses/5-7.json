  "sanskrit": "योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः।\nसर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "yoga-yukto viśuddhātmā vijitātmā jitendriyaḥ |\nsarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā kurvann api na lipyate ||",
  "translation": "One who is united in yoga, whose self is purified, who has conquered the mind and mastered the senses, and whose self has become the Self of all beings—though acting, such a person is not tainted.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics and state of a true karma yogi who has attained spiritual perfection. Krishna outlines four essential qualities: being established in yoga (yoga-yukta), having a purified inner being (viśuddhātmā), having conquered the mind and senses (vijitātmā and jitendriyaḥ), and realizing the unity of all existence (sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā). Such a person sees their own Self in all beings and all beings in their Self, having transcended the limited ego-identification.\n\nThe crucial teaching here is that despite engaging in actions, such a realized soul remains untainted by karma. This is because they act without personal desire or ego-attachment, understanding that actions are performed by the gunas of nature while the true Self remains the witness. This verse directly addresses the central theme of Chapter 5—how one can act in the world while remaining spiritually free. The key is not the cessation of action but the transformation of consciousness through which action is performed.\n\nThis teaching reconciles the apparent contradiction between action and liberation. The verse establishes that liberation is not dependent on physical inaction but on inner purity, self-mastery, and the realization of universal oneness. When one acts from this elevated state of consciousness, no karmic bondage is created, making it possible to live an active life in the world while remaining spiritually liberated.",
