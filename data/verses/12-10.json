  "sanskrit": "अभ्यासेऽप्यसमर्थोऽसि मत्कर्मपरमो भव |\nमदर्थमपि कर्माणि कुर्वन्सिद्धिमवाप्स्यसि ||१०||",
  "transliteration": "abhyāse 'py asamartho 'si mat-karma-paramo bhava |\nmad-artham api karmāṇi kurvan siddhim avāpsyasi ||10||",
  "translation": "If you are unable even to practice this abhyasa yoga, then be intent on performing actions for My sake; even by performing actions for My sake, you shall attain perfection.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His progressive teaching of devotional paths, offering yet another alternative for those who find the previous methods challenging. After recommending abhyasa yoga (practice of constant remembrance) in the previous verse, He now addresses those who may lack the capacity even for such systematic practice. For such aspirants, Krishna prescribes karma yoga dedicated to Him - performing one's duties and actions as an offering to the Divine.\n\nThis approach of mad-artham karma (action for My sake) transforms ordinary worldly activities into spiritual practice. It does not require withdrawal from action or intense meditative practices, but rather a shift in motivation and dedication. By performing one's natural duties - whether as a householder, professional, or in any station of life - with the consciousness that these actions are offerings to God, one purifies the mind and gradually develops devotion. This is a practical path accessible to all, regardless of their circumstances or capabilities. The promise of attaining siddhi (perfection or success) indicates that this path, though seemingly simple, is complete in itself and leads to spiritual realization. This verse demonstrates Krishna's compassionate understanding of human limitations and His provision of multiple accessible paths suited to different temperaments and capacities.",
