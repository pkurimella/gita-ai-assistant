  "transliteration": "sadṛśaṃ ceṣṭate svasyāḥ prakṛter jñānavān api |\nprakṛtiṃ yānti bhūtāni nigrahaḥ kiṃ kariṣyati ||33||",
  "translation": "Even a wise person acts according to their own nature; all beings follow their nature. What can restraint or suppression accomplish?",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a fundamental truth about human behavior and the power of inherent nature (prakriti). He explains that even those who possess knowledge (jñānavān) act in accordance with their own nature, which has been shaped by their past impressions, tendencies, and conditioning. This is not a justification for uncontrolled behavior, but rather a recognition of the deep-seated influence of one's psychological and biological constitution.\n\nThe verse raises an important question: if even the wise cannot escape their nature, what is the use of forceful suppression (nigraha)? Krishna is pointing out that mere external restraint or repression of natural tendencies is ineffective and potentially harmful. This sets up the teaching in the following verses about the proper approach to dealing with attraction and aversion. The key is not violent suppression but intelligent regulation through understanding and spiritual practice. This verse emphasizes the need for self-knowledge and gradual transformation rather than forceful denial of one's nature.\n\nWithin the context of Chapter 3, this verse serves as a bridge between the discussion of performing one's duty and the subsequent teaching about managing likes and dislikes. Krishna is preparing Arjuna to understand that transformation comes through aligned action (svadharma) and self-awareness, not through artificial suppression of one's fundamental nature. The verse acknowledges the reality of human conditioning while pointing toward the need for a more sophisticated approach to spiritual development.",
