  "sanskrit": "न चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो यद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः ।\nयानेव हत्वा न जिजीविषामस्तेऽवस्थिताः प्रमुखे धार्तराष्ट्राः ॥६॥",
  "transliteration": "na caitad vidmaḥ kataranno garīyo yadvā jayema yadi vā no jayeyuḥ |\nyāneva hatvā na jijīviṣāmas te'vasthitāḥ pramukhe dhārtarāṣṭrāḥ ||6||",
  "translation": "We do not know which is better for us—whether we should conquer them or they should conquer us. Even those whom we should not wish to live after killing—the sons of Dhritarashtra—stand before us in battle array.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna expresses the depth of his moral confusion and paralysis. He admits that he cannot determine which course of action would be superior (garīya)—victory or defeat. This is not merely tactical uncertainty but a profound ethical dilemma. If the Pandavas win by killing their relatives, the victory would be hollow and unbearable; if they lose, they face dishonor and subjugation. Either outcome appears unacceptable to Arjuna.\n\nThe verse reveals Arjuna's complete bewilderment about his dharma (duty). He specifically mentions the Dhartarashtras (sons of Dhritarashtra) standing before him, emphasizing that these are not anonymous enemies but his own cousins, teachers, and kinsmen. The phrase 'na jijīviṣāmaḥ' (we would not wish to live) after killing them shows how the prospect of fratricide has made life itself seem meaningless to him. This emotional and intellectual crisis sets the stage for Krishna's teachings on dharma, detachment, and the nature of the self.\n\nThis verse marks the culmination of Arjuna's despondency and confusion. It demonstrates that his crisis is not one of cowardice but of genuine moral perplexity. He is caught between competing duties—the warrior's duty to fight and the universal duty not to harm one's own family. This state of complete uncertainty and inability to discern the right course of action makes him the ideal recipient of Krishna's wisdom, which will address not just this immediate dilemma but the fundamental questions of human existence and duty.",
