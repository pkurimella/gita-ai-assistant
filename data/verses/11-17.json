  "sanskrit": "किरीटिनं गदिनं चक्रिणं च तेजोराशिं सर्वतो दीप्तिमन्तम्।\nपश्यामि त्वां दुर्निरीक्ष्यं समन्ताद्दीप्तानलार्कद्युतिमप्रमेयम्॥",
  "transliteration": "kirīṭinaṁ gadinaṁ cakriṇaṁ ca tejoräśiṁ sarvato dīptimantam |\npaśyāmi tvāṁ durnirīkṣyaṁ samantād dīptānalārkadyutim aprameyam ||",
  "translation": "I see You with crown, mace, and discus; a mass of radiance glowing everywhere, difficult to behold, shining all around like the blazing fire and sun, immeasurable.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna describes the magnificent divine attributes and ornaments of the Universal Form. He sees Krishna adorned with the crown (kirīṭa), wielding the mace (gadā) and the discus (cakra) - the traditional weapons and symbols of Vishnu. The vision is not merely of physical objects but of an overwhelming mass of radiance (tejoräśi) that emanates from all directions, making it extremely difficult to look upon directly.\n\nArjuna compares the brilliance of this cosmic form to the combined radiance of blazing fire (dīpta-anala) and the sun (arka), yet even this comparison falls short as the form is described as 'aprameyam' - immeasurable or incomprehensible. This verse captures the paradox of divine vision: Arjuna is simultaneously able to see the form yet finds it difficult to behold due to its overwhelming effulgence. The description emphasizes both the personal aspect of the Divine (with recognizable symbols like the crown and discus) and the transcendent, infinite nature that defies complete comprehension.\n\nThis verse is significant in establishing the dual nature of divine manifestation - both saguna (with attributes and form) and ultimately beyond all limitations. It demonstrates that even when the Divine assumes a visible form for the devotee, its essential nature remains infinite and incomprehensible to the finite mind, inspiring both devotion and awe.",
