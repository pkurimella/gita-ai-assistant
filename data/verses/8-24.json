  "transliteration": "agnir jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ ṣaṇ-māsā uttarāyaṇam |\ntatra prayātā gacchanti brahma brahma-vido janāḥ ||24||",
  "translation": "Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern course of the sun—departing in these, the knowers of Brahman go to Brahman.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna describes the path of light (śukla-gati or devayāna) by which enlightened souls who have realized Brahman attain liberation. The verse enumerates symbolic temporal markers: fire represents the presiding deity of cremation, light symbolizes the daytime, the bright fortnight (śukla-pakṣa) refers to the waxing moon period, and uttarāyaṇa indicates the six-month period when the sun travels northward. These are not literal requirements but represent the auspicious cosmic conditions and the luminous path taken by liberated souls.\n\nThis verse must be understood in the context of ancient Vedic cosmology and the doctrine of the two paths after death—the path of the gods (devayāna) and the path of the ancestors (pitṛyāna). Those who have attained knowledge of Brahman (brahma-vidaḥ) and depart during these symbolically auspicious periods are said to merge with Brahman and not return to the cycle of birth and death. However, the emphasis is not on the timing of death but on the spiritual realization achieved during life. The temporal references serve as metaphors for the illumined consciousness of the departing soul, suggesting that true knowledge of Brahman, rather than the mere timing of death, is what ensures liberation and prevents rebirth.",
