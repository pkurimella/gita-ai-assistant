  "sanskrit": "समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु न मे द्वेष्योऽस्ति न प्रियः।\nये भजन्ति तु मां भक्त्या मयि ते तेषु चाप्यहम्॥",
  "transliteration": "samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ |\nye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā mayi te teṣu cāpy aham ||",
  "translation": "I am equal to all beings; none is hateful or dear to Me. But those who worship Me with devotion, they are in Me and I am also in them.",
  "commentary": "In this profound verse, Krishna reveals the impartial nature of the Divine while simultaneously explaining the special relationship that develops through devotion. The Lord declares His absolute equality toward all beings—He harbors neither hatred nor favoritism in His essential nature. This establishes the foundational truth that God's grace is available equally to all, without discrimination based on birth, status, or past actions. The Divine does not play favorites; the sun shines equally on all.\n\nHowever, the second half of the verse introduces a crucial distinction: while God's nature remains impartial, those who turn toward Him with devotion (bhakti) establish a reciprocal relationship. The phrase 'mayi te teṣu cāpy aham' (they are in Me and I am in them) reveals the intimate union that develops through devotion. This is not a contradiction but rather shows that while God's essential nature is equal toward all, the experience of divine grace depends on the devotee's receptivity. Just as the sun shines equally on all, but only the open lotus receives its light fully, God's grace flows equally, but only the devoted heart experiences it fully.\n\nThis verse is central to understanding bhakti yoga and resolves the apparent paradox between divine impartiality and divine grace. It assures seekers that God is not distant or partial, yet encourages the practice of devotion by revealing that sincere worship creates a special bond. The verse emphasizes that spiritual progress depends not on God's favoritism but on the individual's choice to turn toward the Divine with love and devotion.",
