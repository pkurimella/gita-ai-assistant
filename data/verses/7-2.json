  "transliteration": "jñānaṁ te 'haṁ sa-vijñānam idaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ |\nyaj jñātvā neha bhūyo 'nyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate ||",
  "translation": "I shall declare to you in full this knowledge combined with realization, knowing which nothing further remains to be known in this world.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Lord Krishna makes a profound promise to Arjuna. He declares that He will impart complete knowledge (jñāna) along with experiential wisdom (vijñāna). The distinction between jñāna and vijñāna is significant: jñāna refers to theoretical or intellectual knowledge of spiritual truths, while vijñāna represents the practical, experiential realization of that knowledge. Krishna promises to reveal both aspects comprehensively (aśeṣataḥ), leaving nothing incomplete.\n\nThe second line emphasizes the completeness and sufficiency of this teaching. Krishna assures that once this knowledge is fully understood and realized, there remains nothing else worth knowing. This is not mere intellectual information but transformative wisdom that addresses the fundamental questions of existence, the nature of reality, and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supreme. This verse sets the stage for the profound teachings that follow in Chapter 7, where Krishna will reveal His divine nature, the relationship between matter and spirit, and how all existence emanates from Him.\n\nThis promise is particularly significant because it indicates that the knowledge Krishna is about to impart is not partial or preliminary, but complete and ultimate. It represents the culmination of spiritual understanding, beyond which no further seeking is necessary. This comprehensive knowledge encompasses both the transcendent and immanent aspects of the Divine, the nature of material and spiritual energies, and the means to attain liberation.",
