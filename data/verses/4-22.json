  "sanskrit": "यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः।\nसमः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते॥",
  "transliteration": "yadṛcchā-lābha-santuṣṭo dvandvātīto vimatsaraḥ |\nsamaḥ siddhāv asiddhau ca kṛtvāpi na nibadhyate ||",
  "translation": "Content with whatever comes unsought, transcending all dualities, free from envy, balanced in success and failure—even while acting, such a person is not bound.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the characteristics of a karma yogi who has attained freedom from bondage even while performing actions. Krishna outlines four key qualities: contentment with whatever comes naturally without effort (yadṛcchā-lābha-santuṣṭa), transcendence of dualities like pleasure-pain and honor-dishonor (dvandvātīta), freedom from jealousy and competitiveness (vimatsara), and equanimity in success and failure (sama). These qualities represent the internal disposition of one who has truly renounced the fruits of action.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that liberation is not dependent on the cessation of action but on the attitude with which action is performed. A person possessing these qualities remains unattached to outcomes, accepting whatever results come as prasāda (grace). This mental equipoise prevents the formation of new karmic bonds. The phrase 'kṛtvāpi na nibadhyate' (even while acting, is not bound) is particularly significant—it demonstrates that action itself does not bind; rather, it is desire, attachment, and identification with results that create bondage. This teaching is central to the Gita's philosophy of karma yoga, showing how one can remain active in the world while being spiritually free.",
