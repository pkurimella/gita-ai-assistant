  "sanskrit": "सत्त्वात्सञ्जायते ज्ञानं रजसो लोभ एव च |\nप्रमादमोहौ तमसो भवतोऽज्ञानमेव च || 17 ||",
  "transliteration": "sattvāt sañjāyate jñānaṁ rajaso lobha eva ca |\npramāda-mohau tamaso bhavato 'jñānam eva ca || 17 ||",
  "translation": "From sattva arises knowledge; from rajas, greed indeed arises; and from tamas arise heedlessness, delusion, and ignorance.",
  "commentary": "This verse delineates the distinct psychological and spiritual effects that arise from each of the three gunas. From sattva (the quality of goodness and purity) springs jñāna or true knowledge—the discriminative wisdom that enables one to perceive reality as it is. From rajas (the quality of passion and activity) emerges lobha or greed—the insatiable desire for acquisition and enjoyment that keeps one bound to material pursuits. From tamas (the quality of darkness and inertia) arise three negative qualities: pramāda (heedlessness or negligence), moha (delusion or bewilderment), and ajñāna (ignorance or absence of knowledge).\n\nThis verse is crucial in understanding how the three gunas shape human consciousness and behavior. It demonstrates that our mental states, cognitive abilities, and moral tendencies are not random but are direct products of which guna predominates in our nature at any given time. The verse serves as a diagnostic tool for spiritual aspirants to identify which guna is currently influencing them by observing their own mental states and inclinations. Krishna presents this teaching to help Arjuna—and all seekers—understand that cultivating sattva while transcending rajas and tamas is essential for spiritual progress, as only through the clarity born of sattva can one ultimately transcend all three gunas and attain liberation.",
