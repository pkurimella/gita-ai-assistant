  "sanskrit": "अहङ्कारं बलं दर्पं कामं क्रोधं परिग्रहम्।\nविमुच्य निर्ममः शान्तो ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते॥",
  "transliteration": "ahaṅkāraṁ balaṁ darpaṁ kāmaṁ krodhaṁ parigraham|\nvimucya nirmamaḥ śānto brahmabhūyāya kalpate||",
  "translation": "Having abandoned egoism, force, arrogance, desire, anger, and possessiveness, free from the notion of 'mine' and peaceful—one becomes fit for union with Brahman.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the essential qualities and purifications required for one who aspires to attain Brahman-realization. Krishna enumerates six major obstacles that must be transcended: ahamkara (ego-sense), bala (use of force or violence), darpa (pride or arrogance), kama (selfish desire), krodha (anger), and parigraha (possessiveness or accumulation). These represent the fundamental binding forces that keep the individual soul entangled in material existence and prevent the recognition of one's true nature as Brahman.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two positive qualities that emerge when these negative traits are abandoned: nirmama (freedom from 'mine-ness' or possessiveness) and shanta (peacefulness or tranquility). The state of being nirmama indicates complete detachment from the sense of ownership over body, relationships, and material objects. Shanta represents the inner peace that naturally arises when the mind is no longer agitated by desires, anger, and ego. Together, these qualities prepare the aspirant for brahmabhuyaya—fitness or qualification for becoming one with Brahman.\n\nThis verse is particularly significant in Chapter 18 as it describes the culmination of the spiritual journey. It comes after Krishna's detailed exposition of the three gunas and various paths of yoga, now pointing to the ultimate qualification for liberation. The verse indicates that moksha is not merely intellectual understanding but requires a complete transformation of one's inner being, where all limiting identifications and negative tendencies are dissolved, making way for the recognition of one's essential divine nature.",
