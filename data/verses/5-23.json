  "transliteration": "śaknotīhaiva yaḥ soḍhuṁ prāk śarīra-vimokṣaṇāt |\nkāma-krodhodbhavaṁ vegaṁ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ ||23||",
  "translation": "One who is able to withstand here in this world, before giving up this body, the impulse born of desire and anger—that person is a yogi, that person is happy.",
  "commentary": "This verse emphasizes the critical importance of mastering one's inner impulses while still living in the physical body. Krishna declares that true success in yoga lies not in escaping the world, but in conquering the twin forces of desire (kāma) and anger (krodha) while actively engaged in life. The word 'ihaiva' (here itself, in this very life) stresses that spiritual attainment must be achieved in the present embodied state, not postponed to some future existence or afterlife.\n\nThe 'vega' or impulse mentioned here refers to the powerful urges that arise from unfulfilled desires and the anger that follows frustration. These forces create turbulence in the mind and drive one toward actions that bind rather than liberate. The person who can resist these impulses through discrimination and self-control is called 'yukta' (united, disciplined) and 'sukhī' (happy). This happiness is not dependent on external circumstances but arises from inner mastery and equanimity.\n\nThis teaching is particularly relevant in the context of Chapter 5, which discusses karma-sannyāsa (renunciation of action). Krishna clarifies that true renunciation is internal—the renunciation of desire and anger—rather than external abandonment of duties. The verse serves as a practical guideline for spiritual aspirants, indicating that liberation is achieved through psychological mastery in the midst of worldly life, making it accessible to all sincere seekers regardless of their external circumstances.",
