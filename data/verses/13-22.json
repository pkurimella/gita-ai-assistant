  "transliteration": "upadraṣṭānumantā ca bhartā bhoktā maheśvaraḥ |\nparamātmeti cāpy ukto dehe 'smin puruṣaḥ paraḥ ||",
  "translation": "The Supreme Spirit in this body is called the Witness, the Permitter, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and also the Supreme Self—the Supreme Purusha.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the Supreme Self (Paramātmā) dwelling within the body through five distinct designations that reveal different aspects of Its relationship with the individual soul and material nature. As the Witness (upadraṣṭā), It observes all activities without involvement. As the Permitter (anumantā), It sanctions the actions of the jīva. As the Supporter (bhartā), It sustains all existence. As the Experiencer (bhoktā), It is the ultimate enjoyer, though distinct from the limited enjoyment of the individual soul. As the Great Lord (maheśvaraḥ), It is the supreme controller of all.\n\nThis verse establishes the crucial distinction between the individual soul (jīvātmā) and the Supreme Soul (Paramātmā) that coexist in the body. While the jīva is bound by karma and experiences the fruits of action in a limited way, the Paramātmā remains transcendent, untouched by material qualities, yet intimately present as the inner witness and supporter. This understanding is central to the chapter's teaching about kṣetra (field) and kṣetrajña (knower of the field). The Supreme Purusha is beyond both, yet pervades all. This realization leads to liberation, as one understands the distinction between the temporary body-mind complex, the individual soul, and the Supreme Self that dwells within all beings as their ultimate reality and source.",
