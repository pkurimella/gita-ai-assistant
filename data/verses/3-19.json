  "translation": "Therefore, always perform your duty efficiently and without attachment. By performing action without attachment, one attains the Supreme.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna provides a clear directive based on the philosophical foundation established in previous verses. He instructs Arjuna to perform his prescribed duties (karma) continuously (satatam) but without attachment (asakta) to the fruits of action. This teaching synthesizes the principle of detached action that forms the core of Karma Yoga. The word 'tasmad' (therefore) connects this instruction to the earlier discussion about how even realized souls like Janaka attained perfection through action, and how Krishna Himself engages in action despite having nothing to gain.\n\nThe verse emphasizes two key elements: consistency in action and detachment from results. The repetition of 'asakta' (without attachment) underscores its importance - first as a qualifier for how one should perform action, and second in explaining how such performance leads to the Supreme. This is not mere mechanical action, but action performed with full engagement yet without selfish desire for personal gain. The 'param' (Supreme) that one attains can be understood both as the highest spiritual realization (moksha) and as the greatest good for society. This teaching reconciles the apparent contradiction between the path of action and the path of renunciation, showing that true renunciation lies not in abandoning action but in abandoning attachment to its fruits. This principle becomes foundational for the entire Gita's teaching on Karma Yoga.",
