  "commentary": "This verse begins a series of verses (13-20) where Krishna describes the qualities of His ideal devotee. These characteristics represent the natural manifestations of a heart purified by devotion. The devotee who harbors no hatred (adveṣṭā) toward any being recognizes the divine presence in all creatures. Such a person naturally becomes a friend (maitraḥ) and compassionate (karuṇa) to all, seeing no fundamental difference between themselves and others.\n\nThe qualities of being free from possessiveness (nirmamaḥ) and ego (nirahaṅkāraḥ) indicate the devotee's freedom from the false identification with the body and material possessions. When one realizes that everything belongs to the Divine and that the individual self is merely an instrument, the notions of 'mine' and 'I am the doer' naturally dissolve. Equanimity in pleasure and pain (sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ) and forgiveness (kṣamī) demonstrate the devotee's stability of mind, rooted in the understanding that all experiences are temporary and are opportunities for spiritual growth. These qualities are not artificially cultivated but emerge spontaneously from genuine devotion and self-realization.",
