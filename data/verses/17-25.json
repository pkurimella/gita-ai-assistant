  "translation": "With the utterance of 'Tat' (That), without aiming at the fruits, various acts of sacrifice, austerity, and charity are performed by seekers of liberation.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the second sacred syllable 'Tat' (That) and its significance in spiritual practice. When aspirants perform sacrifices, austerities, and charitable acts while uttering 'Tat,' they do so without attachment to the fruits of their actions. The word 'Tat' refers to the Supreme Reality or Brahman, indicating that these actions are performed as offerings to the Divine rather than for personal gain. This represents the sattvic mode of action performed with spiritual awareness.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that true seekers of liberation (mokṣa-kāṅkṣibhiḥ) perform their spiritual practices with the understanding that they are serving the transcendent Reality. By invoking 'Tat,' they maintain awareness that all actions are ultimately meant for the Supreme and not for ego gratification. This approach transforms ordinary religious and charitable activities into means of spiritual purification and progress toward liberation. The various acts mentioned—sacrifice, austerity, and charity—when performed with this consciousness, become powerful tools for transcending material bondage and realizing one's true nature.",
