  "commentary": "This verse completes Krishna's explanation of divine incarnation begun in the previous verse. Krishna declares the threefold purpose of His avatāras: to protect the virtuous (sādhus), to destroy evildoers who threaten cosmic order, and most importantly, to re-establish dharma when it declines. The phrase 'yuge yuge' (age after age) emphasizes the cyclical nature of divine intervention, suggesting that whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness prevails, the Divine descends to restore balance.\n\nThis verse has profound theological significance in Hindu philosophy, establishing the doctrine of avatāra (divine incarnation). It assures devotees that the Divine is not indifferent to worldly affairs but actively intervenes to maintain cosmic order. The verse also implies that dharma is not static but requires periodic renewal and reinterpretation. Krishna's promise to manifest repeatedly provides hope and reassurance to spiritual seekers across all ages, affirming that divine grace is always available to those who seek righteousness. This concept has inspired countless devotional movements and reinforces the idea that the Divine is both transcendent and immanent, beyond the world yet intimately involved in its welfare.",
