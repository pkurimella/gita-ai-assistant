  "sanskrit": "लेलिह्यसे ग्रसमानः समन्ताल्लोकान्समग्रान्वदनैर्ज्वलद्भिः |\nतेजोभिरापूर्य जगत्समग्रं भासस्तवोग्राः प्रतपन्ति विष्णो ||",
  "transliteration": "lelihyase grasamānaḥ samantāl lokān samagrān vadanair jvaladbhiḥ |\ntejobhir āpūrya jagat samagraṁ bhāsas tavogrāḥ pratapanti viṣṇo ||",
  "translation": "You are licking up and devouring all the worlds on every side with Your flaming mouths. Filling the entire universe with radiance, Your fierce rays are scorching, O Vishnu!",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Arjuna continues his awe-struck description of the Universal Form, now focusing on the terrifying aspect of cosmic dissolution. He sees the Lord consuming entire worlds with blazing mouths, representing the inevitable destruction that is part of the cosmic cycle. The image of 'licking' (lelihyase) suggests the inexorable nature of time that devours all creation, while the flaming mouths symbolize the fire of cosmic dissolution (pralaya).\n\nThe verse emphasizes the all-pervading nature of the Divine through the imagery of radiance filling the entire universe. Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'Vishnu,' the all-pervading one, recognizing the cosmic function of preservation and dissolution inherent in the Supreme Being. The 'fierce rays' (ugrāḥ bhāsaḥ) that scorch the universe represent not just physical destruction but the burning away of all limited forms and identities in the ultimate reality.\n\nThis vision reveals the complete truth about existence - that creation, preservation, and destruction are all divine functions. The terrifying aspect shown here is meant to inspire both fear and reverence, helping Arjuna understand that the same divine power that sustains life also brings about its end. This understanding is crucial for developing detachment and recognizing the eternal nature of the Self beyond all temporal manifestations.",
