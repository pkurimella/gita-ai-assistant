  "transliteration": "jñānaṁ karma ca kartā ca tridhaiva guṇabhedataḥ |\nprocyate guṇasaṅkhyāne yathāvac chṛṇu tāny api ||",
  "translation": "Knowledge, action, and the doer are declared to be of three kinds according to the distinction of the gunas in the philosophy of the gunas. Hear duly about them also.",
  "commentary": "This verse serves as an introductory statement to the detailed analysis that follows in the subsequent verses. Krishna announces that He will now explain how knowledge (jñāna), action (karma), and the agent or doer (kartā) are each classified into three categories based on the three gunas—sattva, rajas, and tamas. This classification is part of the Sankhya philosophy's systematic understanding of the gunas, which Krishna refers to as 'guṇasaṅkhyāne' (the enumeration or philosophy of the gunas).\n\nThis verse is significant because it establishes the framework for understanding how the three modes of material nature pervade not just external phenomena, but also our internal faculties of knowing, acting, and our very sense of agency. By understanding these distinctions, a spiritual aspirant can recognize which mode is predominant in their consciousness and actions, and thereby make conscious choices to elevate themselves toward sattva and eventually transcend all three gunas. This analytical approach is characteristic of the Gita's practical wisdom, providing seekers with concrete tools for self-assessment and spiritual progress.\n\nThe verse also demonstrates the comprehensive nature of Krishna's teaching in this final chapter, where He systematically categorizes various aspects of human experience according to the gunas. This threefold classification helps practitioners understand that the quality of their knowledge, the nature of their actions, and even their sense of doership are all influenced by the predominant guna operating within them at any given time.",
