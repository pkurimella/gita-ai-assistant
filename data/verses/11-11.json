  "transliteration": "divya-mālyāmbara-dharaṁ divya-gandhānulepanam |\nsarvāścaryamayaṁ devam anantaṁ viśvato-mukham ||11||",
  "translation": "Wearing divine garlands and garments, anointed with divine fragrances, full of all wonders, resplendent, infinite, with faces on all sides.",
  "commentary": "This verse continues Sanjaya's description of the divine universal form (Viśvarūpa) that Krishna revealed to Arjuna. The verse emphasizes the transcendent and magnificent nature of this cosmic vision through a series of divine attributes. The form is adorned with celestial garlands and garments that are not of earthly origin, anointed with divine perfumes that represent the sacred and supernatural nature of the vision. The description conveys that this form transcends all ordinary sensory experience.\n\nThe phrase 'sarvāścaryamayam' (full of all wonders) indicates that every aspect of this universal form is miraculous and beyond human comprehension. The term 'anantam' (infinite) emphasizes the boundless nature of the divine, while 'viśvato-mukham' (faces on all sides) reveals the omnipresent and all-perceiving nature of the Supreme Reality. This multi-faced aspect symbolizes that the Divine sees and encompasses all directions simultaneously, representing God's omniscience and omnipresence. This description prepares the reader for the overwhelming and awe-inspiring vision that Arjuna is about to witness, a vision that will reveal the entire cosmos within the body of Krishna, demonstrating his nature as the Supreme Being who contains and transcends all of creation.",
