  "transliteration": "uccaiḥśravasam aśvānāṁ viddhi mām amṛtodbhavam |\nairāvataṁ gajendrāṇāṁ narāṇāṁ ca narādhipam ||",
  "translation": "Among horses, know Me to be Ucchaihshravas, born of the nectar of immortality; among lordly elephants, I am Airavata; and among men, I am the king.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna continues His enumeration of divine manifestations by identifying Himself with the most excellent representatives in three categories: horses, elephants, and human beings. Ucchaihshravas is the celestial horse that emerged during the churning of the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthan) along with the nectar of immortality (amrita). This divine horse is described in the Puranas as possessing seven heads and being the vehicle of Indra. Airavata is the white elephant, also born from the churning of the ocean, who serves as the mount of Indra, the king of the gods. These mythological references point to beings of supreme excellence and divine origin in their respective categories.\n\nThe mention of the king (narādhipa) among men is particularly significant in the context of the Gita's teaching. Krishna is not merely referring to political power, but to the qualities of leadership, nobility, responsibility, and dharmic governance that an ideal king embodies. The king represents the pinnacle of human excellence in terms of duty, protection of subjects, and righteous rule. This verse reinforces the central theme of Chapter 10, where Krishna reveals that whatever is glorious, prosperous, or powerful in creation is but a partial manifestation of His infinite splendor. By recognizing the divine essence in these supreme manifestations, the devotee learns to see the presence of the Supreme in all of creation, cultivating both discrimination (viveka) and devotion (bhakti).",
