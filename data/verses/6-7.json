  "translation": "For one who has conquered the mind and attained tranquility, the Supreme Self is already reached. Such a person remains equipoised in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as honor and dishonor.",
  "commentary": "This verse describes the state of a self-realized yogi who has achieved mastery over the mind. Krishna explains that for one who has conquered the lower self (jitātmanaḥ) and established inner peace (praśāntasya), the Supreme Self (paramātmā) is already attained and firmly established (samāhitaḥ). This is not a future goal but a present reality for such a person.\n\nThe verse then illustrates this state through practical examples of dualities that ordinarily disturb the mind: physical opposites like cold and heat, emotional opposites like pleasure and pain, and social opposites like honor and dishonor. The self-realized person remains in perfect equanimity (samatva) amidst all these pairs of opposites. This equanimity is not mere indifference or suppression, but arises naturally from the direct experience of the Supreme Self, which transcends all dualities. This verse connects directly to the earlier discussion in the chapter about self-conquest and prepares the ground for the detailed description of meditation practice that follows.",
