  "translation": "When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self alone, free from longing for all desires, then one is said to be established in yoga.",
  "commentary": "This verse defines the state of perfection in yoga meditation. Krishna describes the culminating point of yogic practice when the mind, having been disciplined through sustained practice, becomes completely absorbed in the Self (ātman). The key characteristic of this state is that the mind naturally rests in the Self without being pulled by external objects or desires. The term 'viniyatam' indicates complete regulation and mastery over the mental modifications.\n\nThe phrase 'niḥspṛhaḥ sarva-kāmebhyo' (free from longing for all desires) is crucial. It does not mean mere suppression of desires, but a natural state where the yogi experiences such fulfillment in Self-realization that worldly desires lose their appeal. This is the state of true contentment that arises from within, not dependent on external circumstances. When one reaches this state, they are truly 'yukta' - united or established in yoga.\n\nThis verse serves as a benchmark for measuring one's progress in meditation. It describes not just a temporary meditative state, but a stable condition of consciousness where the mind has found its true home in the Self. This is the goal toward which all the previous instructions on posture, breath control, and mental discipline have been leading. It represents the fulfillment of dhyana yoga and prepares the ground for the highest realization.",
