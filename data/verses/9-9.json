  "translation": "But these actions do not bind Me, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna). I remain seated as one neutral, unattached to these actions.",
  "commentary": "In this verse, Krishna addresses a potential philosophical dilemma: if He is the creator and sustainer of all cosmic activities, why is He not bound by karma like ordinary beings? Krishna explains that despite being the source of all creation and activity, He remains completely detached and unaffected by these actions. He sits like one who is neutral (udāsīnavat), like a witness who observes but does not participate with attachment.\n\nThis verse is crucial for understanding the nature of divine action versus human action. While humans become bound by their actions through attachment, desire, and ego, Krishna's actions are performed without any personal motive or attachment to results. He acts, yet remains actionless in essence. This teaching provides the philosophical foundation for karma yoga—the path of selfless action. Just as the Supreme Lord performs cosmic functions without attachment, humans too can engage in necessary actions while remaining internally detached, thereby avoiding karmic bondage.\n\nThe verse also establishes an important distinction between mere activity and binding action. It is not action itself that binds, but the attachment (sakti) and sense of doership associated with it. Krishna demonstrates the possibility of perfect action combined with perfect freedom, serving as the ultimate model for spiritual practitioners who seek liberation while fulfilling their worldly duties.",
