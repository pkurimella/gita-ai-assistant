  "translation": "Arjuna said: O Janardana, if You consider knowledge to be superior to action, then why do You engage me in this terrible action, O Keshava?",
  "commentary": "This verse marks the beginning of the third chapter and reveals Arjuna's continued confusion despite Krishna's teachings in the previous two chapters. Arjuna has heard Krishna extol both the path of knowledge (jnana-yoga) and the path of action (karma-yoga), but he perceives an apparent contradiction. If wisdom and knowledge are superior, as Krishna seemed to suggest, then why is he being urged to engage in the violent action of war?\n\nArjuna's question reflects a common misunderstanding about the relationship between knowledge and action. He assumes these are mutually exclusive paths, failing to grasp that true knowledge must manifest through appropriate action. His use of the term 'ghora karma' (terrible action) reveals his emotional aversion to fighting his relatives and teachers. This verse sets up Krishna's detailed exposition on karma-yoga in this chapter, where He will clarify that action performed without attachment, as an offering to the Divine, is itself a path to liberation and is not contradictory to the path of knowledge. The question demonstrates that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient; one must integrate wisdom with action in daily life.",
