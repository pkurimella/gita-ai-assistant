  "commentary": "This verse begins Chapter 16, where Krishna systematically enumerates the divine qualities (daivi sampad) that lead to liberation, contrasting them with demoniac qualities that lead to bondage. Krishna lists twenty-six divine virtues across the first three verses of this chapter, starting with abhaya (fearlessness) as the foundational quality. Fearlessness here refers not to physical courage alone, but to the spiritual fearlessness that comes from self-knowledge and freedom from attachment to the perishable.\n\nThe qualities mentioned in this verse form the foundation of spiritual development. Sattva-saṁśuddhi (purity of heart) refers to the purification of one's inner nature, while jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti indicates firm establishment in the path of knowledge. The practical virtues of charity (dāna), self-control (dama), sacrifice (yajña), scriptural study (svādhyāya), austerity (tapas), and straightforwardness (ārjava) create the ethical and spiritual framework necessary for spiritual evolution. These qualities are not merely moral prescriptions but represent the natural expression of one who is progressing toward self-realization.\n\nIn the broader context of the Gita, this chapter serves as a practical guide for discriminating between qualities that elevate consciousness and those that degrade it. Having taught Arjuna about various paths to liberation in previous chapters, Krishna now provides clear markers to assess one's own spiritual progress and tendencies. This enumeration helps the spiritual aspirant cultivate divine qualities consciously while recognizing and eliminating demoniac tendencies.",
